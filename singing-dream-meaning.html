"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

                                            I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”

"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Skip to content</p><p>Song Meanings and Facts</p><p>MASKED WOLF</p><p>“Astronaut in the Ocean” by Masked Wolf</p><p>BY AMANDA LONDON · PUBLISHED MARCH 3, 2021 · UPDATED MARCH 3, 2021</p><p></p><p>As implied in this post’s tail end, up until the release of “Astronaut in the Ocean”, Masked Wolf wasn’t necessarily a successful musician. That may explain why, according to his own words, he was dealing with a severe case of mental depression when he put this song together. That being said, it is important to mention that mental health has also been his signature topic.</p><p></p><p>Track "Masked Wolf"</p><p>on Bandsintown</p><p>And accordingly what we were dealing with in terms of the title is an analogy. The way it has been described is as being based on the fact that astronauts tend to train for being in space by performing similar tasks underwater. And metaphorically, the artist’s depression is also “deep” like the depths of the sea. </p><p></p><p>So that is why he “feel(s) like an astronaut in the ocean”, with the astronaut being himself, and the ocean being symbolic of the overall, encompassing anguish he is experiencing.</p><p></p><p>Lyrics of "Astronaut in the Ocean"</p><p>And as alluded to earlier, he does sort of imply in the first verse that such may be due to his career not progressing as idealized. But harping too much on the depressing aspect of this song takes away from its conclusive meaning. For as far as the actual verses are concerned, “Astronaut in the Ocean” isn’t so much about the artist being overwhelmed by his problems as it is his resolve to overcome them. In fact as things progress the lyrics themselves become more braggadocious in nature.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Indeed in many regards the Masked Wolf comes off as your quintessential rapper. For instance, he presents himself as somewhat of a womanizer and an artist with exceptional lyrical skills. But there is a humble, even semi-religious tone underneath it all. </p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>So conclusively we can say that yes, the vocalist at hand may at times feel overwhelmed by the weight of the world. But he possesses a type of faith and work ethic which will not allow him to actually be overcome by such.</p><p></p><p>Release Date of “Astronaut in the Ocean”</p><p>Masked Wolf is a rapper from Australia who became professionally active in 2018. And heading into 2021 Astronaut in the Ocean, which came out on 6 June 2019, remains his most-famous (and only chart-worthy) song.</p><p></p><p>This track was originally released under a label called Teamwrk Records. But after blowing up on social media, Elektra Records re-released it in early-January 2021. In the process, Elektra also signed Masked Wolf to a multi-album contract. However, he still remains affiliated with Teamwrk. And the following month, the song proceeded to exceed 100,000,000 streams on Spotify.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Even More Accomplishments</p><p>This track topped music charts in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It actually proved to be especially popular in Europe, where it charted in a slew of countries. It charted in approximately 20 nations overall. This included “Astronaut in the Ocean” making an appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart. In the latter case, it broke the top 20.</p><p></p><p>Writing and Production</p><p>Masked Wolf wrote this song alongside its producer, Tyron Hapi, another Sydney-based musician. It didn’t blow up until a year after being released, with the intro in particular being heavily utilized by TikTokers. And overall, it appears as if the success of this track may prove to shed a whole new light on hip-hop emanating from Australia in general.</p><p></p><p>It has also been noted that NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who used the song on an Instagram post, contributed to its virality.</p><p></p><p>Who is Masked Wolf?</p><p>As of early-2021 not much public information is available on Masked Wolf. He is 29 years old at the time, and based on images of the rapper he doesn’t necessarily appear to be a native (i.e. White) Australian. He rather looks like someone who is perhaps of Middle Eastern descent. </p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile the name Masked Wolf alludes to the dual-nature of the artist. What this basically means is that he is (based on his own words) someone “you wouldn’t even think [is] a rapper” outside of the studio.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Masked Wolf gives a shoutout to Kendrick Lamar and his 2012 track “Swimming Pools (Drank)” in this song.</p><br />

                            14. I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I
have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.” I have a
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have
a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama—with its vicious racists, with its
Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification—one
day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and
mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be plain and the crooked places will
be made straight, “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together.”
This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith
we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we
will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
free one day. And this will be the day. This will be the day when all of God’s children will
be able to sing with new meaning, “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I
sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside,
let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom
ring from the mighty mountains of New York; let freedom ring from the heightening
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that.
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia; let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
“From every mountainside, let freedom ring.”
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children—black men and white men, Jews and
Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.”

What could possibly happen if their efforts to achieve democracy would generate physical violence in the process?"

                        The African-American community would be able to exercise their rights and live lives that are not under discrimination and threat. They would be able to contribute greater to society because they are not being inhibited by hate and stigma from the community. The<strong> African - American culture </strong>would have an earlier role in shaping the American countryThen Dr. Kng’s speeches would have been considered a failure, because Dr. King <strong>envisioned</strong> a future where there are no prejudices, not only towards his own race but to all races. If this would result in violence then everything that he would have fought for would be for naught because enacting violence in the name of freedom would only further the cycle of hate that he wished to stop.I would like to ask him how he was able to do it to forego violence in exchange for a better way, a peaceful way of demonstration. I would ask him for advice and how he was able to be brave and stand up for what is right. I would ask for stories to inspire me and motivate me to become a better person in a world that is broken and hated. Given the chance and the background, yes I would dream the same dream. Knowing what the African - American community has been through and currently going thru, I think I would also dream of a better country for my people and all the other people residing in our country. I would dream of a society no longer gripped and overcome with hate and prejudice but a country of inclusion and equity. It would have been freeing both in mind, body, and spirit, knowing that something that his ancestors fought for and suffered for has finally come to fruition it would have been an unreal and freeing moment for him The is nothing more powerful than a united society with respect and care for each other.
