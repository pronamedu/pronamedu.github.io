Make sure your serving plates are small enough to let cach food item stand out, but big enough that the portions don't look tiny, 2. Dishes look more interesting when they're in sets of odd numbers, rather than even numbers, 3. Any garnishes on the plate should be not be edible and should enhance the flavor of the main dishes, 4. It's good to have a little bit of height, 5. Vegetables should cover about half of the plate, starch one fourth, and protein one fourth 8. Presentation of a dish adds value to the dining experience and provides room 7. A mix of dull colours and neutral tones provides a pleasing contrast. 6. The use of colour can be employed to highlight the strong points of a dish 9. Colorful plates with different designs are popular to use because they create high contrast and provide a neutral background for your colorful crea tions 10. A contrast of textures tends to draw the eye, and satisfy the palette​</a>

Use the information provided below to help you design your experiment. Consider weighing, drying, and grinding method in your experiment. 1. Ask a question which you want to find an answer to. 2. Perform background research on your topic of choice. 3. Write down your hypothesis. 4. Identify variables important to your investigation: those that are relevant, those you can measure or observe. 5. Decide on the independent and dependent variables in your experiment, and those variables that must be kept constant. 6. Design the experiment you will use to test your hypothesis: State the aim of the experiment. • List the apparatus (equipment) you will need to perform the experiment. • Write the method that will be used to test your hypothesis in bullet format in the correct sequence, with each step of the experiment numbered. • Indicate how the results should be presented, and what data is required.this is actually research sub but yeah I hope you can help meh​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Step 1: Question / questioning</p><p>The first of the steps of the scientific method consists of the question, in the initial approach of the question. This step is critical because it allows us to start the process and determine where it will go.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the researcher in question will pose a question, a question, with the aim of solving it through the following 5 steps. They are usually questions related to observations already made, that is to say, they are not “random” questions that one can just think of. These questions are usually of the following type: What, Why, How, When, etc.</p><p></p><p>Step 2: Observation</p><p>The second step of the scientific method is observation. It consists of the first making contact with reality that we want to study. Observing implies “actively acquiring information through sight”.</p><p></p><p>Observation also includes looking at the details of what we are studying, analysing the causes and consequences of the events. However, its main objective is to gather as much information as possible in relation to the initial question raised in step 1. This observation, moreover, must be intentional, that is, focused on seeking results.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>On the other hand, the information transcribed through observation must be accurate, verifiable and measurable.</p><p></p><p>Step 3: formulating the hypothesis</p><p>After observing the object of study and gathering information on the question initially raised, we will proceed to develop step 3 of the 6 steps of the scientific method: the formulation of a (or more) hypothesis. This hypothesis, logically, will have to do with the initial question, i.e. it will attempt to answer that question/question.</p><p></p><p>Scientific method-Diagram</p><p>Explanatory diagram of the steps of the scientific method.</p><p>But what exactly is a hypothesis? It consists of a formulation generally affirmative, that is used to predict an outcome. From this, the research or experiment in question can be initiated, which will have the purpose of deducing if this affirmation is real or not.</p><p></p><p>If it is false, we can reformulate the initial hypothesis into a new one, changing data or characteristics. In other words, the hypothesis is intended to be proven; it can be real (affirmative) or not (null), in the event that it is refuted.</p><p></p><p>Step 4: Experimentation</p><p>The next step in the scientific method is experimentation, that is, the testing of the hypothesis on the basis of an experiment. That is to say, it implies taking to the practical field the previous steps (initial question, hypothesis…), studying the phenomenon in question (which is usually reproduced in a laboratory through artificial and experimental techniques).</p><p></p><p>In addition, through experimentation the necessary and/or interesting conditions are created to replicate and study a specific phenomenon.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Through experimentation, the results are obtained.

Data generally consist of numbers, “presence” or “absence” responses, “yes” or “no” responses, and so on, it all depends on the type of experiment and the assessment or observation scales used.</p><p></p><p>It’s important write down all the data we have at our disposalincluding those we did not expect or initially believe to be irrelevant to the hypothesis.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>The results or data obtained can essentially be of three types: results that refute the initial hypothesis, that confirm it or that do not provide sufficient information to allow us to refute or confirm the hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>Step 6: Accept or reject the initial hypothesis</p><p>The last of the 6 steps of the scientific method involves accepting or refuting (reject) the initial hypothesis. In other words, it is intended to answer the initial question raised in step 1.</p><p></p><p>The conclusions reached are based on an informal or statistical analysis. In the first case (informal), we must ask ourselves: Do the data obtained reinforce our hypothesis? In the second case (statistical) we must establish a numerical degree of “acceptance” or “rejection” of the hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>Technically, the scientific method ends in step 6; however, it is also true that additional steps can be added, depending on the characteristics of our research.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            27. Activity 2: Designing an Experiment Direction: In this activity you are required to design your own experiment. Use the information provided below to help you design your experiment. Consider weighing, drying, and grinding method in your experiment. 1. Ask a question which you want to find an answer to. 2. Perform background research on your topic of choice. 3. Write down your hypothesis. 4. Identify variables important to your investigation: those that are relevant, those you can measure or observe. 5. Decide on the independent and dependent variables in your experiment, and those variables that must be kept constant. 6. Design the experiment you will use to test your hypothesis: State the aim of the experiment. • List the apparatus (equipment) you will need to perform the experiment. • Write the method that will be used to test your hypothesis in bullet format in the correct sequence, with each step of the experiment numbered. • Indicate how the results should be presented, and what data is required.this is actually research sub but yeah I hope you can help meh​</h2><br />
