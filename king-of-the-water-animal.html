STORY:
THE ‘SINGA’ 
Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and
wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart.
Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving
the king a shock...but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only
grazing the animal. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag
up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand- an island. Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him.
“What is the name of that island?” The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.”
“Then we are going there.” The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship
carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning. However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his
grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his
crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown
immediately and threw it into the sea. All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear
and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and
the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and
moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red
body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden
eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle.
“What sort of animal was that?”, the king asked. A wise old man stepped forth.
I have seen animals in portraits from the Far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.”
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live
here...here in the island of Singapura.”</a>

A LION AND A RABBIT Once a lion said to all the animals in the forest that if one of them will come to him as his meal for the day, he would not kill anyone else among them. All the animals agreed to this. One day, it was a rabbit's turn and it took quite long reaching the lion. The lion asked it the reason for being late. It acted wisely and said, "Sir! I was stopped by another lion, who was claiming to be the king of the jungle and he wants to meet you." "So do I", said the furious lion. The rabbit took the lion to a well and showed him his reflection in the water of the well. The lion jumped into the well to catch his opponent and drowned. How intelligently, the rabbit got rid of the wild beast. What theme can we get from the story?​</a>

The crocodile has a narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer. _________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat, sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring an umbrella or pack up a raincoat. ___________4. A cat is the perfect pet. Cats are really so cute. They make people happy by petting. It reduces stress because they are calm. Having a cat will be easy. I will feed the cat. Yosef can help me clean the litter box.

                                            What’s New Activity 3: Read Me Reading Text No.1 
 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

                                            4) Why did the King break his promise? What happened to the land after the King broke his word? The Tortoise and The KingM.I. OgumefuOne year the Elephant had done a great deal of damage, breaking down the trees,drinking up the water in a time of scarcity, and eating the first tender crops from thefields.The King’s hunters tried in vain to destroy him, for Elephant knew many charms, and
always escaped from their traps.At last, the King offered the hand of his daughter in marriage to anyone who wouldrid the country of the pest.Tortoise went to the palace and offered to catch Elephant, and then made hispreparations. Outside the town a large pit was dug, and on the top of it was laid athin platform covered with velvet cloths and leopard-skins, like a throne.Then Tortoise set off into the forest, accompanied by slaves and drummers.Elephant was very much surprised to see his little friend Tortoise riding in suchstate, and suspected a trap; but Tortoise said that the old King was dead and thepeople all wished Elephant to rule over them, because he was the greatest of allanimals.When he heard this, Elephant was flattered, and agreed to accompany Tortoise tothe town. But when he went up on to the platform to be crowned King, the woodgave way beneath him, and he crashed down into the pit and was speedily slain bythe King’s hunters.All the people rejoiced, and praised the cunning of Tortoise, who went to the palaceto receive his bride. But the King refused to give his daughter to such aninsignificant creature, and Tortoise determined to take his revenge.When the new crops were just ripening, he called together all the field mice andelves, and asked them to eat up and carry away the corn. They were only toopleased with the idea, and the farmers in distress found the fields quite bare.Now there was prospect of a famine in the land, and the King offered the samereward as before to anyone who would rid the country of the pests.The King was thus forced to consent to the marriage, and when it had taken place,Tortoise, true to his word, called together all the mice and elves and showed them aplatform loaded with dainty morsels of food.
He then addressed them as follows: “The people are so distressed at the damageyou have done, that they have prepared this feast for you, and they promise to dothe same twice every year, before the harvesting of the first and second crops, if youwill agree not to touch the corn in the fields.”The little creatures all consented, and marched in a great crowd to the platform,which they soon cleared. The King and his people were not very pleased to hear ofthis arrangement, but they were so afraid of Tortoise that they could not complain,and after that the mice and elves never troubled the country again.

STORY:
THE ‘SINGA’ 
Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king was restless by nature and
wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart.
Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving
the king a shock...but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag, only
grazing the animal. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
The stag run through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag
up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand- an island. Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him.
“What is the name of that island?” The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.”
“Then we are going there.” The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship
carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and get most of the cargo for jettisoning. However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his
grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his
crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown
immediately and threw it into the sea. All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear
and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and
the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and
moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red
body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden
eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle.
“What sort of animal was that?”, the king asked. A wise old man stepped forth.
I have seen animals in portraits from the Far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.”
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live
here...here in the island of Singapura.”</h2><br />

                        THE DAY THE FROG CRIED<strong>Pollution</strong> due to expanded industrialization in the city caused  the deaths of many animals in the story.Dirty water, used chemicals and oils, sewage, and cafeteria waste are frequently dumped directly into the ground or into a community water source, such as a river, lake, or stream. Dumped waste can contaminate groundwater, which feeds other water sources such as wells and ponds.Development is very fast since people want more, fast and easy. Because of that, it is destroying locals, animals, and the whole ecosystem.<strong>Development and progress also cause pollution</strong> of our air and water, soil degradation, deforestation, and biodiversity loss. With the establishment of the capitalistic system, population and productivity growth are unavoidable. As a result, human production, transportation, and social activities, like the greenhouse effect, will increase greenhouse emissions such as methane and carbon dioxide.As in the story, the lands provide shelter, food, oxygen, and water purification. The pollution from The Man from the City's factory destroys the quality of the air and water without trees or water, changing the landscape and continuing to drive animals away.If I was the King Frog, I will not trust the Man from the City. I will not let him step into the land. Some of the simple and standard measures to control water pollution are effluent sewage treatment, proper incineration, reducing the use of chemical fertilizers, and, if possible, reusing the water.Big business and industrialists are represented by the Man from the City. Humans like more money without thinking of the consequences.Human behavior can either make or break his environment, either protecting or destroying it.<strong>Be informative about what actions or products contributes to pollution. </strong><p></p><p><strong>Days the Frog Cried</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9215392</p><p></p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

The crocodile has a narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer. _________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat, sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring an umbrella or pack up a raincoat. ___________4. A cat is the perfect pet. Cats are really so cute. They make people happy by petting. It reduces stress because they are calm. Having a cat will be easy. I will feed the cat. Yosef can help me clean the litter box.

                            27. What’s New Activity 3: Read Me Reading Text No.1 
 THE ‘SINGA’ Sang Nila Utama, an imaginative and adventurous king, was restless by nature and wanted to travel to faraway places. He loved hunting wild animals, so when he heard that there were stags in the jungles of Tanjong Bentam, which were not easy to hunt, he was excited and took with him a great fleet of ships to Tanjong Bentam. 
When the king arrived upon the island, he and his subjects had a hunting expedition that lasted several hours, slaying many wild and savage beasts, but no stags. This disappointed the king, for he had a sense of unfulfillment in his heart. Suddenly, a large stag darted out of the bush in front of Sang Nila Utama, giving the king a shock…but the king drew his silver dagger and hurled it at the stag. The stag began to run and the king pursued it (in those days, it was either your feet or nothing).
 The stag ran through the jungle and darted up a knoll. The king followed the stag up the hill, but upon reaching the summit, the stag was nowhere to be seen. There was a large rock, so the king climbed it and looked at the land and the sea spread out around him. In the distance, he saw a stretch of white sand–an island. 
Sang Nila Utama was fascinated by the sight of the island. He turned to one of his subjects who had followed him. 
“What is the name of that island?” 
The subject looked into the distance and smiled. “That is Temasek, Your Highness.” 
“Then we are going there.” 
The king ordered his fleet to set sail and they began on their journey towards the island. 
Suddenly the once clear blue skies were covered with black clouds, heavy rain poured from them, and strong bursts of wind threatened to tear the ships apart. The ship carrying Sang Nila Utama was in the very eye of the storm. The crew lowered the sails, started to bail the water from the ship and got most of the cargo for jettisoning. 
However, an idea came to the king’s head. He remembered a story his grandfather told him of how one of his ancestors became the Sea-King and that his crown was the only thing which belonged to his ancestor. He removed his crown immediately and threw it into the sea. 
All at once, the storm broke. As suddenly as it started, the skies began to clear and the crew gave a shout of joy and set sail once more to the island of Temasek. 
When the king stepped upon the island, a creature stepped out of nowhere, and the king and his men were awe-struck by the magnificent creature. It was large and moved with grace, had a black head, covered in a furry mane, a whitish neck and a red body. When the king drew his bow and arrow, the beast stared back at him with golden eyes and let out a deafening roar before leaping into the jungle. 
“What sort of animal was that?” the king asked. 
A wise old man stepped forth. 
“I have seen animals in portraits from the far West. Perhaps this is a ‘singa’ but I wonder how he got all the way here.” 
“This must be a great place if it breeds such a beautiful animal. Let us live here…here in the island of Singapura.” 
(Singa – the word ‘singa’ is actually the Malay word for “lion.” Therefore, Singapore is sometimes referred to as the “Lion City.”)

                            28. 4) Why did the King break his promise? What happened to the land after the King broke his word? The Tortoise and The KingM.I. OgumefuOne year the Elephant had done a great deal of damage, breaking down the trees,drinking up the water in a time of scarcity, and eating the first tender crops from thefields.The King’s hunters tried in vain to destroy him, for Elephant knew many charms, and
always escaped from their traps.At last, the King offered the hand of his daughter in marriage to anyone who wouldrid the country of the pest.Tortoise went to the palace and offered to catch Elephant, and then made hispreparations. Outside the town a large pit was dug, and on the top of it was laid athin platform covered with velvet cloths and leopard-skins, like a throne.Then Tortoise set off into the forest, accompanied by slaves and drummers.Elephant was very much surprised to see his little friend Tortoise riding in suchstate, and suspected a trap; but Tortoise said that the old King was dead and thepeople all wished Elephant to rule over them, because he was the greatest of allanimals.When he heard this, Elephant was flattered, and agreed to accompany Tortoise tothe town. But when he went up on to the platform to be crowned King, the woodgave way beneath him, and he crashed down into the pit and was speedily slain bythe King’s hunters.All the people rejoiced, and praised the cunning of Tortoise, who went to the palaceto receive his bride. But the King refused to give his daughter to such aninsignificant creature, and Tortoise determined to take his revenge.When the new crops were just ripening, he called together all the field mice andelves, and asked them to eat up and carry away the corn. They were only toopleased with the idea, and the farmers in distress found the fields quite bare.Now there was prospect of a famine in the land, and the King offered the samereward as before to anyone who would rid the country of the pests.The King was thus forced to consent to the marriage, and when it had taken place,Tortoise, true to his word, called together all the mice and elves and showed them aplatform loaded with dainty morsels of food.
He then addressed them as follows: “The people are so distressed at the damageyou have done, that they have prepared this feast for you, and they promise to dothe same twice every year, before the harvesting of the first and second crops, if youwill agree not to touch the corn in the fields.”The little creatures all consented, and marched in a great crowd to the platform,which they soon cleared. The King and his people were not very pleased to hear ofthis arrangement, but they were so afraid of Tortoise that they could not complain,and after that the mice and elves never troubled the country again.
