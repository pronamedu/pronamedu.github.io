Motion is the change in object position with respect to a reference point. 4. Spee Ichc2. The rotation of planets around the sun it shows thet an object is in constant motion. 3. Distance has magnitude only, while displacement has magnitude and direction. determines how fast or slow the object is moving. 5. If an object move at 115 km/h Northwest, it described its velocity. 6. If a boy runs the 400-meter dash in 40 seconds, his average speed is 10m/s. 7. When an object in motion changes its velocity(speed/direction), it shows acceleration. 8. Obeying the traffic rules is a safety tip on the road while riding a bicycle. 9. If the car is at REST, there is no acceleration on the object. 10. Throwing a stone on the water a circular rippled formed, it shows that waves carries enere 11. In the ROYGBIV colors of light violet has the greater energy compared to red. 12. Light travel faster than sound waves. 13. Metals are example of conductor, because they absorb heat easily. 14. Sound is an example of Longitudinal waves. 15. Amplitude refer to the height of the waves from its origin. 16. The higher the amplitude the greater its energy. 17. In constructing a Distance-time graph, the position or distance is in the Y-axis and th time is in the X-axis. 18. In a longitudinal wave, the vibration is parallel to the direction of the wave 19. Wavelenght is known as the height of the wave. 20.Amplitude focuses on the loudness and intensity of sound. passes through different media. 21. The speed of sound changes as 22. Sound wave travels fastest in solids and slowest in gas. 23. The highness or lowness of sound is called pitch. 24. The higher the frequency of sound waves, the higher the pitch. 25. Red light has longer wavelength but lower in frequency, while violet light has sho wavelength but higher in frequency. 26. Red and green combination of colors for visible light is correct. 27. If an object releases heat, the temperature of the object is lower. 28. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy from one object to another, while temper refers to the degree of coldness or hotness of an object. 29. When a a metal spoon put in a glass of boiling water, the heat energy flows boiling water to the metal spoon. 30. Convection happens when there is a difference in temperature both in liquid 31. Sun bathing on the beach is an example of radiation 32. Boiling water, air-conditioner and hot air balloon are examples of convection​</a>
