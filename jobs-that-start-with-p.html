                                            The Glitch By Divina P. Maming Dela Cruz family came together for breakfast. Each had his/her own story to tell about his/her experiences for the week. This is the usual scenario every Sunday morning. "Good morning kids!" greeted the mother who had just finished setting the table for five. Tonio and Maria could not wait to reach for their chairs with a big grin on their faces as they said, "Good morning, nanay!" Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother. "Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo," she remarked. "Yeah, I know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today," she answered. Criselda replied, "I can’t wait to taste it!" Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on, his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged his shoulders for disappointment. "Let’s eat!" mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they saw him in a really low spirit. "What happened?" at last, the wife asked. "I may lose my job," he said with a croaky voice. "But why?" Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked towards him and patted his shoulder. "It’s okay. You can still find another job," she said offering him a seat. The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, "Tatay, don’t worry, we are here to help." 7 CO_Q1_Oral Communication SHS Module 2 "Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours," Tonio said. "Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income," Maria added. Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores. "Thank you, my dear children," was all Aling Terie could say. Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their activities in school and how they fared in their subjects. Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, "I got highest score in Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate." Tonio then mentioned about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked about what she learned from it. Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call. As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work the next day again. All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all together. "We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual," Mang Cardo sighed with relief. Now, answer the following questions: 1. What are the different communication scenarios in the story? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 2. How did each communication scenario develop? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 3.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                                            The Glitch By Divina P. Maming Dela Cruz family came together for breakfast. Each had his/her own story to tell about his/her experiences for the week. This is the usual scenario every Sunday morning. "Good morning kids!" greeted the mother who had just finished setting the table for five. Tonio and Maria could not wait to reach for their chairs with a big grin on their faces as they said, "Good morning, nanay!" Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother. "Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo," she remarked. "Yeah, I know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today," she answered. Criselda replied, "I can’t wait to taste it!" Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on, his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged his shoulders for disappointment. "Let’s eat!" mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they saw him in a really low spirit. "What happened?" at last, the wife asked. "I may lose my job," he said with a croaky voice. "But why?" Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked towards him and patted his shoulder. "It’s okay. You can still find another job," she said offering him a seat. The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, "Tatay, don’t worry, we are here to help." 7 CO_Q1_Oral Communication SHS Module 2 "Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours," Tonio said. "Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income," Maria added. Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores. "Thank you, my dear children," was all Aling Terie could say. Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their activities in school and how they fared in their subjects. Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, "I got highest score in Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate." Tonio then mentioned about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked about what she learned from it. Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call. As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work the next day again. All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all together. "We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual," Mang Cardo sighed with relief. Now, answer the following questions: 1.

                                            The Glitch
By Divina P. Maming
Dela Cruz family came together for
breakfast. Each had his/her own
story to tell about his/her
experiences for the week. This is the
usual scenario every Sunday
morning.
“Good morning kids!” greeted the
mother who had just finished
setting the table for five. Tonio and
Maria could not wait to reach for
their chairs with a big grin on their
faces as they said, “Good morning,
nanay!”
Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on
but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother.
“Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo,” she remarked. “Yeah, I
know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today,” she
answered. Criselda replied, “I can’t wait to taste it!”
Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He
was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on,
his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged
his shoulders for disappointment.
“Let’s eat!” mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody
seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they
saw him in a really low spirit. “What happened?” at last, the wife asked.
“I may lose my job,” he said with a croaky voice.
“But why?” Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked
towards him and patted his shoulder. “It’s okay. You can still find another job,” she
said offering him a seat.
The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, “Tatay,
don’t worry, we are here to help.”

Module 2
“Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours,” Tonio said.
“Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income,” Maria added.
Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores.
“Thank you, my dear children,” was all Aling Terie could say.
Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an
all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their
activities in school and how they fared in their subjects.
Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, “I got highest score in
Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate.” Tonio then mentioned
about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked
fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really
work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked
about what she learned from it.
Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing
lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call.
As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment
was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work
the next day again.
All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all
together. “We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual,” Mang Cardo sighed
with relief.

It generally defines art produced after the Modern Art movement to the present day. However, modern artwork is not just art produced during a specific time-frame. This genre of art does have its own approach or style that distinguishes it from others. </p><p></p><p>Yet, this style of art is difficult to define because it includes such variety. Some argue that the basic approach and goal of modern Art is to challenge the nature of artwork itself. It can also make the viewer question what it is that defines art. Therefore, this style of art is not particularly uniform, and it may be more challenging to precisely describe than any other genre of art. Additionally, there are several major reasons to why contempory art is important to society, for instance it is a mean to express oneself as it is way to provide social and cultural commentary. </p><br />

                            9. The Glitch By Divina P. Maming Dela Cruz family came together for breakfast. Each had his/her own story to tell about his/her experiences for the week. This is the usual scenario every Sunday morning. "Good morning kids!" greeted the mother who had just finished setting the table for five. Tonio and Maria could not wait to reach for their chairs with a big grin on their faces as they said, "Good morning, nanay!" Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother. "Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo," she remarked. "Yeah, I know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today," she answered. Criselda replied, "I can’t wait to taste it!" Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on, his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged his shoulders for disappointment. "Let’s eat!" mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they saw him in a really low spirit. "What happened?" at last, the wife asked. "I may lose my job," he said with a croaky voice. "But why?" Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked towards him and patted his shoulder. "It’s okay. You can still find another job," she said offering him a seat. The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, "Tatay, don’t worry, we are here to help." 7 CO_Q1_Oral Communication SHS Module 2 "Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours," Tonio said. "Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income," Maria added. Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores. "Thank you, my dear children," was all Aling Terie could say. Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their activities in school and how they fared in their subjects. Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, "I got highest score in Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate." Tonio then mentioned about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked about what she learned from it. Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call. As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work the next day again. All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all together. "We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual," Mang Cardo sighed with relief. Now, answer the following questions: 1.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                            25. The Glitch
By Divina P. Maming
Dela Cruz family came together for
breakfast. Each had his/her own
story to tell about his/her
experiences for the week. This is the
usual scenario every Sunday
morning.
“Good morning kids!” greeted the
mother who had just finished
setting the table for five. Tonio and
Maria could not wait to reach for
their chairs with a big grin on their
faces as they said, “Good morning,
nanay!”
Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on
but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother.
“Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo,” she remarked. “Yeah, I
know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today,” she
answered. Criselda replied, “I can’t wait to taste it!”
Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He
was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on,
his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged
his shoulders for disappointment.
“Let’s eat!” mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody
seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they
saw him in a really low spirit. “What happened?” at last, the wife asked.
“I may lose my job,” he said with a croaky voice.
“But why?” Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked
towards him and patted his shoulder. “It’s okay. You can still find another job,” she
said offering him a seat.
The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, “Tatay,
don’t worry, we are here to help.”

“Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours,” Tonio said.
“Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income,” Maria added.
Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores.
“Thank you, my dear children,” was all Aling Terie could say.
Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an
all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their
activities in school and how they fared in their subjects.
Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, “I got highest score in
Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate.” Tonio then mentioned
about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked
fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really
work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked
about what she learned from it.
Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing
lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call.
As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment
was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work
the next day again.
All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all
together. “We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual,” Mang Cardo sighed
with relief.
