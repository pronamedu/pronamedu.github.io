                            10. what did peter do upon seeing that cornelius and his family also receive the holy spirit (I need answer)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Acts 10:1-48
</p><p>Peter and Cornelius
</p><p>10In Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian Cohort, as it was called. 2He was a devout man who feared God with all his household; he gave alms generously to the people and prayed constantly to God. 3One afternoon at about three o’clock he had a vision in which he clearly saw an angel of God coming in and saying to him, ‘Cornelius.’ 4He stared at him in terror and said, ‘What is it, Lord?’ He answered, ‘Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. 5Now send men to Joppa for a certain Simon who is called Peter; 6he is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.’ 7When the angel who spoke to him had left, he called two of his slaves and a devout soldier from the ranks of those who served him, 8and after telling them everything, he sent them to Joppa.
</p><p>
</p><p>9 About noon the next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. 10He became hungry and wanted something to eat; and while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance. 11He saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down, being lowered to the ground by its four corners. 12In it were all kinds of four-footed creatures and reptiles and birds of the air. 13Then he heard a voice saying, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat.’ 14But Peter said, ‘By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean.’ 15The voice said to him again, a second time, ‘What God has made clean, you must not call profane.’ 16This happened three times, and the thing was suddenly taken up to heaven.
</p><p>
</p><p>17 Now while Peter was greatly puzzled about what to make of the vision that he had seen, suddenly the men sent by Cornelius appeared. They were asking for Simon’s house and were standing by the gate. 18They called out to ask whether Simon, who was called Peter, was staying there. 19While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, ‘Look, three* men are searching for you. 20Now get up, go down, and go with them without hesitation; for I have sent them.’ 21So Peter went down to the men and said, ‘I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for your coming?’ 22They answered, ‘Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.’ 23So Peter* invited them in and gave them lodging.
</p><p>
</p><p>The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the believers* from Joppa accompanied him. 24The following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 25On Peter’s arrival Cornelius met him, and falling at his feet, worshipped him. 26But Peter made him get up, saying, ‘Stand up; I am only a mortal.’ 27And as he talked with him, he went in and found that many had assembled; 28and he said to them, ‘You yourselves know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or to visit a Gentile; but God has shown me that I should not call anyone profane or unclean. 29So when I was sent for, I came without objection. Now may I ask why you sent for me?’
</p><p>
</p><p>30 Cornelius replied, ‘Four days ago at this very hour, at three o’clock, I was praying in my house when suddenly a man in dazzling clothes stood before me. 31He said, “Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. 32Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon, who is called Peter; he is staying in the home of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.” 33Therefore I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. So now all of us are here in the presence of God to listen to all that the Lord has commanded you to say.’</p><br />

 D.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>B. He was not present when I was loaning games <strong>;</strong> consequently<strong>,</strong> he did not receive any.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The use of a semicolon is to <strong>separate two closely related independent clauses</strong> but <strong>remove the pause</strong> that would be provided if a period was used instead. It allows a better flow even with the separation.</p><p></p><p>It is common to put a <strong>semicolon before</strong> the words: <strong>so, hence, then, for example, nevertheless, etc.</strong> In the given, it is the word <strong>consequently. </strong>Moreover, <strong>after</strong> the words stated beforehand, we separate it with a <strong>comma</strong> to continue the thought. </p><p></p><p>Hence, the corrected sentence would be:</p><p>B.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jews believe that at the moment the Hebrews forged a special and unique relationship with God.

From that moment on, Moses resolved to lead his people out of Egypt to the land of milk and honey.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>When Moses and the Israelites reach Mount Sinai God reminds them how he has saved them and then says; "Now, if you obey me completely and keep my covenant, you will be my treasured possession among all peoples, though all the earth is mine" </p><br />

                            29. 1440g of honey were divided among 3 people. I received 5/12 of the total amount and my brother received 3/7 of the remainder. My sister received the rest.1. How many grams of honey did I receive? ( Show your work. )2. How many grams of honey did my sister receive? ( Show your work. )​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Let's break down the problem step by step.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>First, we need to find the total amount of honey that my brother and sister received combined. We know that I received 5/12 of the total amount, so my brother and sister received 1 - 5/12 = 7/12 of the total amount.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Next, we know that my brother received 3/7 of the remainder. To find the remainder, we can multiply the total amount by 7/12 (since that's how much my brother and sister received combined) and subtract the amount my brother received. This gives us:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>remainder = 1440g * 7/12 - (1440g * 5/12) = 560g</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>So my brother received 3/7 * 560g = 240g.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Finally, we can find how much my sister received by subtracting the amount my brother received from the remainder:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>sister = 560g - 240g = 320g</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Therefore, the answers to the questions are:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1. I received 5/12 * 1440g = 600g of honey.</strong></p><p><strong>2. My sister received 320g of honey.</strong></p><br />
