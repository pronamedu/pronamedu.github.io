                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) The non-living components of the environment are known as abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include things such as rocks,water,soil,light,rocks etc...</p><p></p><p>2.) An autotroph is an organism that can produce its own food using light, water, carbon dioxide, or other chemicals. Because autotrophs produce their own food, they are sometimes called producers. Plants are the most familiar type of autotroph, but there are many different kinds of autotrophic organisms.</p><p></p><p>3.) More importantly, decomposers make vital nutrients available to an ecosystem's primary producers—usually plants and algae. Decomposers break apart complex organic materials into more elementary substances: water and carbon dioxide, plus simple compounds containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium.</p><p></p><p>4.) Biotic factors or living parts of the ecosystem include animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. Plants and algae are called producers. They produce oxygen and food that animals need. Animals are called consumers.</p><p></p><p>5.) A carnivore is an organism that eats mostly meat, or the flesh of animals. Sometimes carnivores are called predators.</p><p></p><p>6.) Competition is an interaction between organisms that are attempting to obtain the same resource. Organisms compete for everything, including space, food, water, mates, and anything else that increases their chances for survival and reproductive success.</p><p></p><p>7.) Community: A biological community consists of all the populations of different species that live in a given area. Community ecologists focus on interactions between populations and how these interactions shape the community.</p><p></p><p>8.) The wasp and fungus are mutually supportive. The fungus benefits by hitching a ride to new host trees, where it can spread and ultimately produce fruiting bodies - shelf mushrooms known as mossy maze polypore. The wasp depends on the fungus to complete its life cycle.</p><p></p><p>9.) The fungus, Heterobasidion annosum, spreads the most when stumps are freshly cut. Wind or splashing rain can carry the fungus from infected stumps to healthy trees that have cut surfaces. After landing, the spores then penetrate the wood to establish an infection.</p><p></p><p>10.) Biotic factors are living or once-living organisms in the ecosystem. These are obtained from the biosphere and are capable of reproduction. Examples of biotic factors are animals, birds, plants, fungi, and other similar organisms.</p><p></p><p>11.) An organism lives in its habitat within a community. The role or job of an organism within a community is its niche.</p><p></p><p>12.) A habitat is a place where an organism makes its home. A habitat meets all the environmental conditions an organism needs to survive.</p><p></p><p>13.) A carnivore is an organism that eats mostly meat, or the flesh of animals. Sometimes carnivores are called predators.</p><p></p><p>14.) The correct answer is Snake. Snakes are Carnivores means that they feed only on other animals such as rodents, lizards, and even the eggs of other reptiles.</p><p></p><p>15.) A scavenger is an organism that mostly consumes decaying biomass, such as meat or rotting plant material. Many scavengers are a type of carnivore, which is an organism that eats meat. ... Scavengers are a part of the food web, a description of which organisms eat which other organisms in the wild</p><p></p><p>16.) habitat, place where an organism or a community of organisms lives, including all living and nonliving factors or conditions of the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>17.) In ecology, the term “niche” describes the role an organism plays in a community. A species' niche encompasses both the physical and environmental conditions it requires (like temperature or terrain) and the interactions it has with other species (like predation or competition).</p><p></p><p>18.)Symbiosis is an ecological relationship between two species that live in close proximity to each other. Organisms in symbiotic relationships have evolved to exploit a unique niche that another organism provides.</p><p></p><p>19.) Parasitism is the type of symbiosis where one organism is benefited and the other is harmed.</p><p></p><p>20.) Mutualism, a relationship in which both species benefit, is common in nature.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pabrainliest Po plss:)</p><p>#cary on learning </p><p></p><br />
