The two are very lovely, sweet and cute. They kiss and waggletheir tails every time Conching either goes out or comes home.One day, Conching came home looking sad and very anxious. Shecalled Potchi and Chichi, talked to them as if the two understood her well. Sherevealed to them series of challenges that she is facing at the moment. Sheclaimed that life has been very unfair for her. She could not even pay thesmall bills she used to laughed at and could not buy food for them.Thinking of what else she can do to overcome her problems, Conchingthought of ending her life so that everything will simply come to pass.Night came, on her bed, Conching texted several of her friends asking for helpin any way they can. She even called up some of them. Unfortunately, noneof her contacts responded. Potchi and Chichi, kissed her jumped over herbody back and forth, waggle their tails, frying to put her to sleep. When thenight became deeper, the two fell asleep. Conching, having hard time tosleep, grievously grabbed a knife and cut her wrist. Blood was flooding thefloor. She groaned when Chichi noticed that Conching is struggling of pain,she quickly jumped out of the bed. She bit Potchi's tail and seemingly askedfor help. The two dogs dragged Conching out of the house barking trying to,catch the attention of passers-by and the people in the neighborhood. A manwho had just been out of a night shift job caught their attention and hurriedlywent inside the front yard of the house, dialed his phone via 911.Indeed, sometimes, the ones you least expected to share with your pains andstruggles, are the ones who cheer you up and even save you from the worst.Nasa taas po yung tanong ​</a>
