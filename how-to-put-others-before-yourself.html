At breaktime, she made conversation with her classmates and tried making lots of jokes for them to like her. But the other kids just gave her strange looks and started avoiding her. Morning classes have ended. So at lunch time, she decided to just be herself. She reintroduced herself to her seatmates she approached before, and asked about their weekend and their hobbies.

So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.

                                            Read the story and answer the following questions. A young student, was one day taking a walk with a professor, who was commonly called the students' friend, from his kindness to those who waited on his instructions. As they went along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field close by, and who had nearly finished his day's work. The student turned to the professor, saying: "Let us play the man a trick: we will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them." "My friend" answered the professor, "we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. But you are rich, and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some unknown hand, would save from perishing. The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. "Now," said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick?" The youth replied, "You have taught me a lesson which I will never forget. I feel now the truth of those words, which I never understood before: 'It is more blessed to give than to 1.

                                            The Story of Mariang SinukuanOnce upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and Sinukuan used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to see at their doorstep's fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was Mariang Sinukuan who left these foods And to show their gratitude and respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people considered her home as a sacred place. But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted to get more. One day, some young men decided to go up mt. Arayat. They wanted to get more of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. They started for the mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise. Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big ruits they bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one's reach. Fowls of every kind were plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were still viewing this wonder of nature vhen from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan. They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not End any words to say to her. It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them." Welcome to my ome, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as you can but I'm warning you not to ake anything home without my knowledge.” With this, the enchanted lady departed.After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits. They ate and ate until they could not eat any more. "Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which brought," said one. "No, let's not do that. Let's go home now," said another. "I'm scared." " Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?" But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge." "Oh, come on. She won't know we took home fruits and animals. They're so plentiful, she won't know the difference." And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn't mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They remenbered Mariang Sinukuan's warning. The young men became terribly frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry them. But before they reached the base of the mountain, who did they see blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry. "You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me. You are inot satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I'm going to turn you all into a swine." With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men into swine. This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. Again, and again they tried to steal them. At last, ed up with the people's greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at their doorsteps. She aused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to disappear. She no longer showed herself to e people for she was disgusted with their greediness.1. If you were Mariang Sinukuan, would you give them the same punishment?2. What are the values can we get or learn from the story of mariang sinukuan? ​pahelp po pls ng maayos na sagot ty. </a>

                                            The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</a>

But the boy took care to sit on the far side of the room where he thought she could easily see him out of the corner of her eye, if she wanted to. He did not trust the woman not to trust him. And he did not want to be mistrusted now. A resolution C. exposition falling action D. climax​</a>

So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.

As they went along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field close by, and who had nearly finished his day's work. The student turned to the professor, saying: "Let us play the man a trick: we will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them." "My friend" answered the professor, "we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. But you are rich, and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some unknown hand, would save from perishing. The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. "Now," said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick?" The youth replied, "You have taught me a lesson which I will never forget. I feel now the truth of those words, which I never understood before: 'It is more blessed to give than to   1.

The Story of Maria Sinukuan
Once upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit
trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed
this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit
trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and the animals was no
other than Mariang Sinukuan. These fruit trees and animals, Mariang Sinukuan
used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to
see at their doorsteps fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was
Mariang Sinukuan who left this foods while they were sleeping. How grateful the
people were to be graced by the enchanted lady. And to show their gratitude and
respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people
considered her home as a sacred place.
But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no
longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted
to get more.
One day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat. They wanted to
get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They started for the
mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise.
Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate
branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big fruits they
bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one’s reach. Fowls of every kind were
plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were
still viewing this wonder of nature when from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan.
They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not find any words to say to her.
It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them.
” Welcome to my home, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as
you can but I’m warning you not to take anything home without my knowledge.”
With this, the enchanted lady departed.
After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits.
They ate and ate until they could not eat any more.
“Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which I brought,” said one.
“No, let’s not do that. Let’s go home now,” said another. “I’m scared.”
” Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?”
” But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge.”
“Oh, come on. She won’t know we took home fruits and animals. They’re so
plentiful, she won’t know the difference.”
And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and
animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were
about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn’t
mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load
was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men
were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They
remembered Mariang Sinukuan’s warning. The young men became terribly
frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry
them. But before they reached the base of the mountain whom did they see
blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry.
“You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me.
You are not satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even
try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I’m going to turn you all into a
swine.” With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men
into swine.
This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang
Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Again and again they tried to steal them. At last,
fed up with the people’s greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at
their doorsteps. She caused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to
disappear. She no longer showed herself to the people for she was disgusted
with their greediness.</a>

The Old Man, His Son, and a DonkeyA man and his son were once going with their donkey to market.As they were walking along by its side, they passed a group of women, one of whom said, “You fools, what is aDonkey for but to ride upon?  So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge.

                            7. Read the story and answer the following questions. A young student, was one day taking a walk with a professor, who was commonly called the students' friend, from his kindness to those who waited on his instructions. As they went along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field close by, and who had nearly finished his day's work. The student turned to the professor, saying: "Let us play the man a trick: we will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them." "My friend" answered the professor, "we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. But you are rich, and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some unknown hand, would save from perishing. The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. "Now," said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick?" The youth replied, "You have taught me a lesson which I will never forget. I feel now the truth of those words, which I never understood before: 'It is more blessed to give than to 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. After reading the story, I have come to the conclusion that it is about the <strong>joy of giving</strong>. The young boy first wanted to play a mean trick on the poor farmer, but the teacher stopped him. Instead, the teacher asked him to do something nice for the stranger and watch what was going to happen.</p><p>2. The story has <strong>moved </strong>me. I understand how the boy felt. It has made me feel <strong>more willing to do kind things </strong>for other people. Likewise, I can better appreciate all the acts of kindness that I have experienced in my life.  </p><p>3. If I were in the shoes of the farmer, I would also <strong>feel shocked and grateful</strong>. Life has clearly not been good to the poor man, who had to work under the heat of the sun to support his loved ones. When you are feeling down, a little help can go a long way. It is also moving to know that there are <strong>people who care about me </strong>even if we do not know each other.</p><p>4. The author is trying to say that when you are in the position to help other people, you should not hesitate to do so. <strong>This is not only for the person but also for your own sake</strong>. By helping other people, you will get more joy from knowing that you have done some good in the world.</p><p>5. The short story wanted to show that <strong>we should help people who are less fortunate </strong>than we are. An act of kindness will always be better than a mean joke. It is good to spread love and kindness whenever you can. The two coins might have been nothing to the rich boy, but it made such a big difference to the poor man.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p><p>I agree with the author. There is no joy in making fun of people who are already feeling down. It might be funny to you, but it will make things so much more difficult for them. Instead, we should all focus our attention and energy into helping others. <strong>Every act of kindness goes a long way</strong>. In both small and big ways, there are always things we can do to make life at least a bit better and easier for others. The joy we get from these actions is always going to be more satisfying than the laughs we get from mean pranks.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This is the definition of a short story: https://brainly.ph/question/10282148</p><br />

                            9. The Story of Mariang SinukuanOnce upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and Sinukuan used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to see at their doorstep's fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was Mariang Sinukuan who left these foods And to show their gratitude and respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people considered her home as a sacred place. But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted to get more. One day, some young men decided to go up mt. Arayat. They wanted to get more of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. They started for the mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise. Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big ruits they bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one's reach. Fowls of every kind were plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were still viewing this wonder of nature vhen from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan. They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not End any words to say to her. It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them." Welcome to my ome, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as you can but I'm warning you not to ake anything home without my knowledge.” With this, the enchanted lady departed.After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits. They ate and ate until they could not eat any more. "Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which brought," said one. "No, let's not do that. Let's go home now," said another. "I'm scared." " Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?" But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge." "Oh, come on. She won't know we took home fruits and animals. They're so plentiful, she won't know the difference." And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn't mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They remenbered Mariang Sinukuan's warning. The young men became terribly frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry them. But before they reached the base of the mountain, who did they see blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry. "You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me. You are inot satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I'm going to turn you all into a swine." With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men into swine. This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. Again, and again they tried to steal them. At last, ed up with the people's greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at their doorsteps. She aused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to disappear. She no longer showed herself to e people for she was disgusted with their greediness.1.

                            10. The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</h2><br />

The Old Man, His Son, and a DonkeyA man and his son were once going with their donkey to market.As they were walking along by its side, they passed a group of women, one of whom said, “You fools, what is aDonkey for but to ride upon?  So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.

I.               Read the story and answer the following questions.  A young student, was one day taking a walk with a professor, who was commonly called the students' friend, from his kindness to those who waited on his instructions. As they went along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field close by, and who had nearly finished his day's work. The student turned to the professor, saying: "Let us play the man a trick: we will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them." "My friend" answered the professor, "we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. But you are rich, and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some unknown hand, would save from perishing. The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. "Now," said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick?" The youth replied, "You have taught me a lesson which I will never forget. I feel now the truth of those words, which I never understood before: 'It is more blessed to give than to   1.

The Story of Maria Sinukuan
Once upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit
trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed
this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit
trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and the animals was no
other than Mariang Sinukuan. These fruit trees and animals, Mariang Sinukuan
used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to
see at their doorsteps fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was
Mariang Sinukuan who left this foods while they were sleeping. How grateful the
people were to be graced by the enchanted lady. And to show their gratitude and
respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people
considered her home as a sacred place.
But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no
longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted
to get more.
One day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat. They wanted to
get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They started for the
mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise.
Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate
branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big fruits they
bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one’s reach. Fowls of every kind were
plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were
still viewing this wonder of nature when from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan.
They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not find any words to say to her.
It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them.
” Welcome to my home, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as
you can but I’m warning you not to take anything home without my knowledge.”
With this, the enchanted lady departed.
After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits.
They ate and ate until they could not eat any more.
“Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which I brought,” said one.
“No, let’s not do that. Let’s go home now,” said another. “I’m scared.”
” Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?”
” But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge.”
“Oh, come on. She won’t know we took home fruits and animals. They’re so
plentiful, she won’t know the difference.”
And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and
animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were
about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn’t
mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load
was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men
were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They
remembered Mariang Sinukuan’s warning. The young men became terribly
frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry
them. But before they reached the base of the mountain whom did they see
blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry.
“You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me.
You are not satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even
try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I’m going to turn you all into a
swine.” With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men
into swine.
This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang
Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Again and again they tried to steal them. At last,
fed up with the people’s greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at
their doorsteps. She caused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to
disappear. She no longer showed herself to the people for she was disgusted
with their greediness.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>        Once upon a time there was a girl named Mariang Sinukuan. She lived in Mt. Arayat that abounded in all kinds of fruit and trees and all kinds of animals roamed around there. Mariang Sinukuan helps the peolple there by giving fruits and animals and that gains their respect for her. But one day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat to get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Mariang Sinukuan saw them and told them to eat as much as they can but don't take anything home without her knowledge but they did not obey her instead they fill their sacks with fruits and animals making Mariang Sinukuan angry and punish by turning them into a swine. This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They tried to steal them and because of that she stopped leaving food at</p><p>their doorsteps. And eventually hide herself together with the fruit and animals from the people for she was disgusted with their greediness.</p><br />
