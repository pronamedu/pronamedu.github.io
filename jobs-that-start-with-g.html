                                            Ask most people which day of the week they fear the most and the answer is likely to be Monday. The first day of the working week can make us depressed. (1)_____ The most depressing day of the year is the third Monday in January, when it's cold and dark outside. This day was named "Blue Monday" by psychologist Cliff Arnall. Even if there was little science behind Blue Monday, it's probably true that the sound of our alarm clock on any Monday morning means the coming of a new working week and possibly the end of our weekend of fun. (2)______It's what psychologists call an emotional shift, and no other part of the week has a transition like it. Apparently, Monday means the end of weekend lie-ins. (3)_____According to a website, "If you can't stand your job, then the Monday blues can be very real." And it can be especially difficult to start another seemingly endless workweek. Your case of the Mondays can have a negative impact on your performance, productivity and the people around you. (4)______ Feeling a bit low shouldn't be confused with more serious depression, caused by other factors. Claudia Hammond, an author and presenter, argues that this low feeling might be untrue. (5)_____She mentions an Australian study of how people reflected on their mood and found the day that scored the lowest was in fact Wednesdays. So, when Monday comes, maybe we should give it a second chance! A. But is Monday as bad as we like to think it is? B. What exactly makes us feel down remains unknown. C. Weekends are definitely happy days in all countries. D. That's why the feeling is described as the Monday blues. E. There is a strong cultural idea that we don't like Mondays. F. Our Monday mood can be based on a direct comparison to the day before. G. It's back to the routine and the realization that there are five days of working ahead.​</a>

                            13. Ask most people which day of the week they fear the most and the answer is likely to be Monday. The first day of the working week can make us depressed. (1)_____ The most depressing day of the year is the third Monday in January, when it's cold and dark outside. This day was named "Blue Monday" by psychologist Cliff Arnall. Even if there was little science behind Blue Monday, it's probably true that the sound of our alarm clock on any Monday morning means the coming of a new working week and possibly the end of our weekend of fun. (2)______It's what psychologists call an emotional shift, and no other part of the week has a transition like it. Apparently, Monday means the end of weekend lie-ins. (3)_____According to a website, "If you can't stand your job, then the Monday blues can be very real." And it can be especially difficult to start another seemingly endless workweek. Your case of the Mondays can have a negative impact on your performance, productivity and the people around you. (4)______ Feeling a bit low shouldn't be confused with more serious depression, caused by other factors. Claudia Hammond, an author and presenter, argues that this low feeling might be untrue. (5)_____She mentions an Australian study of how people reflected on their mood and found the day that scored the lowest was in fact Wednesdays. So, when Monday comes, maybe we should give it a second chance! A. But is Monday as bad as we like to think it is? B. What exactly makes us feel down remains unknown. C. Weekends are definitely happy days in all countries. D. That's why the feeling is described as the Monday blues. E. There is a strong cultural idea that we don't like Mondays. F. Our Monday mood can be based on a direct comparison to the day before. G. It's back to the routine and the realization that there are five days of working ahead.​</h2><br />
