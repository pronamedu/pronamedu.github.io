                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The Earth's internal heat source provides the energy for our dynamic planet, supplying it with the driving force for plate-tectonic motion, and for on-going catastrophic events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p><p>2. Igneous rocks are also very important because their mineral and chemical makeup can be used to learn about the composition, temperature and pressure that exists within the Earth's mantle. They can also tell us much about the tectonic environment, given that they are closely linked to the convection of tectonic plates.</p><br />
