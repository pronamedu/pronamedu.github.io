Just like a birthday is a special day to celebrate a person Earth Day is a special daythat celebrates the Earth Earth Day was born on April 22, 1970 in San Francisco, California. Every year,America and over 100 different countries join together in the celebration of Earth Day on April 22nd Earth dayis the largest, most celebrated environmental event worldwide. On Earth Day, we rememeber to appreciatenature and learn ways to protect our environment. Find ways that you can help keep the planet clean andprotect our environment!schThe Earth is humongous, having the diameter of 7. 926 miles. It orbits around the sum of a speed of 18.5miles per second or 67,000 miles per hour. Seventy one percent of the Earth's surface is water: the PacificOcean makes up 70 million squared miles of that coverage. The force of gravity is strong that you would needto travel at a speed at least seven miles per second to escape it. Approximately two million species of animals,plants and other organisms have been identified and named: it is estimated that approximately 50 millionspecies have yet to be identified.If everyone in the United States recycled their newspapers, the lives of 41,000 tress woul be spared. Onesingle tree can detoxify the air of up of to 60 pounds of pollutants. To make an aluminum can from recycledmaterials takes only five percent of the energy normally needed to make acan, an energy savings Of 95%.The energy saved by recycling just one aluminum can is enough to power a television set for three hours.Recycling glass bottles allows the energy consumption for new glass products to be cut in half.Answer the comprehension check.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>HELLO!<p></p><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>The Sun rotates approximately every 25 days. Earth revolves, or travels on an orbit, around the Sun. An orbit is the path along which an object travels around another object. For Earth to make one full revolution around the Sun, it takes about 1 year.<strong>)</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>As the world has warmed, the seasons have shifted, bringing longer, hotter summers, shorter winters and more frequent and damaging 'false springs'. ... The researchers also found that average seasonal temperatures have increased: summers have heated at a rate of 0.089°C per decade and winter by 0.26°C per decade.<strong>)</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>Axial Precession Earth's axis appears stable, but it actually wobbles very slowly, like a spinning top. It takes Earth's axis about 26,000 years to complete a circular "wobble." This wobble is called axial precession.<strong>)</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>365.24 days The motion around the sun along its orbit is called a revolution. The amount of time it takes for a single trip around the sun is called a period of revolution. The period for the Earth to revolve around the sun is 365.24 days or one year.<strong>)</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>the movement of one object around another object such as the Earth's orbit around the sun is called revolution. The path of an object as it revolves around another object in space is called an orbit<strong>)</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>Latitude and Temperature At higher latitudes, the Sun's rays are less direct. The farther an area is from the equator, the lower its temperature. At the poles, the Sun's rays are least direct. Much of the area is covered with ice and snow, which reflect a lot of sunlight.<strong>)</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>Earth's closest approach to the sun, called perihelion, comes in early January and is about 91 million miles (146 million km), just shy of 1 AU. The farthest from the sun Earth gets is called aphelion. It comes in early July and is about 94.5 million miles (152 million km), just over 1 AU.<strong>)</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>During the 2012 perihelion, the Earth was about 91.3 million miles (147 million km) from the sun, or about 0.983 AU. The Earth will reach aphelion on July 5.<strong>)</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>Earth orbits the Sun in a slightly flattened circle called an "ellipse." In geometry, the ellipse is a curve that loops around two points called "foci." The distance from the center to the longest ends of the ellipse is called the "semi-major axis," while the distance to the flattened "sides" of the ellipse is called<strong>)</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>The tropical year is the period of time required by the sun to pass from vernal equinox to vernal equinox. It is equal to 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds, or 365.2422 days. The tropical year is used to keep track of seasons, planting, and harvesting.<strong>)</strong><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>k</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>D</strong></p><p><strong>T</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>K</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>U</strong></p><p></p><br />

It orbits around the sum of a speed of 18.5miles per second or 67,000 miles per hour. Seventy one percent of the Earth's surface is water: the PacificOcean makes up 70 million squared miles of that coverage. The force of gravity is strong that you would needto travel at a speed at least seven miles per second to escape it. Approximately two million species of animals,plants and other organisms have been identified and named: it is estimated that approximately 50 millionspecies have yet to be identified.If everyone in the United States recycled their newspapers, the lives of 41,000 tress woul be spared. Onesingle tree can detoxify the air of up of to 60 pounds of pollutants. To make an aluminum can from recycledmaterials takes only five percent of the energy normally needed to make acan, an energy savings Of 95%.The energy saved by recycling just one aluminum can is enough to power a television set for three hours.Recycling glass bottles allows the energy consumption for new glass products to be cut in half.Answer the comprehension check.1.

It is closest to the sun at 147 million kilometers when it is in its orbit's perihelion. 6. It is farthest from the sun at 152 million kilometers when it is in its orbit's aphelion. 7. Perihellon is the point in the orbit of Earth at which it is closest to the sun. 8. The aphellon is the point in the orbit of Earth where it is farthest from the sun. 9. Earth revolves around the sun as shown in figure 1 or spins on its axls. 10. One complete revolution is equal to one year and it is 365.24 solar days or 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds. Earth's axis is tilted.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Use compound interest formulas</p><p>Savings instruments in which earnings are continually reinvested, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, use compound interest. The term compounding refers to interest earned not only on the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account.</p><p></p><p>The annual percentage rate (APR) of an account, also called the nominal rate, is the yearly interest rate earned by an investment account. The term nominal is used when the compounding occurs a number of times other than once per year. In fact, when interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective interest rate ends up being greater than the nominal rate! This is a powerful tool for investing.</p><p></p><p>We can calculate the compound interest using the compound interest formula, which is an exponential function of the variables time t, principal P, APR r, and number of compounding periods in a year n:</p><p></p><p>A</p><p>(</p><p>t</p><p>)</p><p>=</p><p>P</p><p>(</p><p>1</p><p>+</p><p>r</p><p>n</p><p>)</p><p>n</p><p>t</p><p>For example, observe the table below, which shows the result of investing $1,000 at 10% for one year.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The “fixed” tilt means that, during our orbit around our Sun each year, different parts of Earth receive sunlight for different lengths of time. It also means that the angle at which sunlight strikes different parts of Earth's surface changes through the year. Sunlight striking the surface at an angle is “spread” across a wider area compared to sunlight striking perpendicular to Earth's surface. Areas that receive more scattered sunlight receive less energy from our Sun. All of these factors combine to give Earth its annual</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>brainlest pls</p><br />
