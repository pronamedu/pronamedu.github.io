                                            please helptrue or false?1. From the most ancient times the blessed virgin has been honored with the title of "mother of God" to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and needs.2. The virgin Mary most perfectly embodies the obedience of faith.3. Mary's response to God's call to be the mother of God teaches us virtues of hope and love that all christians may follow in their response to their own devine callings.4. Respect for the human person entrails respect for the animals that flow from his dignity as a creature.5. Created in the image of the one God and equally endowed with rational souls,all men have the same nature and the same origin.6. God promises us that our suffering will ultimately be followed by glory.7. Only few persons want to be free and enjoy living a peaceful life.8. Despair is only contrary to God's goodness, to his justice-for the lord is faithful to his promises-and to his mercy.9. The moral law finds its fullness and it's unity in Christ.10. The natural law expresses the dignity of the person and determines the basis for his fundamental rights and duties. ​</a>
