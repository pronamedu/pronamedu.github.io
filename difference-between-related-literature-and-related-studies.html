                                            TRUE OR FALSE_____1. In quantitative research, researchers know in advance what they are looking for. _____2. Quantitative research can be easily misinterpreted because it provides numerical data. _____3. Quantitative research puts emphasis on proof, rather than discovery. _____4. In writing the literature review, avoid treating each article or related study as a separate paragraph. _____5. Normative research is conducted by researcher whose aim would be to find out the direction and/or               relationship between different variables or group of respondents under study. _____6. Qualitative research requires a large number of respondents. It assumes that the larger the sample is, the                  more statistically accurate the findings are. _____7. The Review of Related Literature is an alphabetical listing of authors or sources used in writing the                 research paper. _____8. In writing the title of your research paper, it is always best to start it with phrases like ‘A Study to Show’,                ‘An Inquiry into’ and ‘An Investigation of’. _____9. Evaluation describes the status of a phenomenon at a particular time. It describes without value judgement                a situation that prevents. _____10. Correlational is conducted by researchers whose aim would be to find out the direction and/or relationship                 between different variables or groups of respondents under study. _____.11. It is correct to conduct research without informing your respondents about the procedures, potential risks                    and benefits that the research would bring. ______12. Intellectual honesty must be upheld in the planning, execution and writing of the research report. ______13. Methodological is the implementation of a variety of methodologies that forms a critical part of achieving                 the goal of developing a scaled-matched approach, where data from different discipline can be integrated. ______14. One characteristics of quantitative research is that its method can be repeated to verify findings in another                  setting, thus, reinforcing validity findings. ______15. In quantitative experiments it filters out external factors, if properly designed, and so the results gained                  can be seen, as real and unbiased.​</a>

                        <strong>Research</strong><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a research there are chapters and formats that needs to be followed and in every chapter there are corresponding requirements that needs to be fulfilled in a specified time. An example of this is the chapter one, where most of the introductory phrases and citations are included, it also wise to look out for proper citation since we do want to credit real owners of their sayings and work.
</p><p><strong>Related Literature:
</strong></p><p>News Articles
</p><p>Book Citations
</p><p>Official website’s opinions and facts
</p><p>Related Studies:
</p><p>Hardbound Thesis
</p><p>Online researches
</p><p>Government public data
</p><p>What is the difference of <strong>related literature</strong> and related studies?
</p><p><strong>Related literature</strong> are often from journalist or any officials whereas the opinions and facts presented matters and can affect the masses’ opinion and thinking. Related Studies are from researchers or from official public offices, and thesis from different universities and libraries. </p><p>Most of these are accessible and that is why we need proper citation of others’ work.
