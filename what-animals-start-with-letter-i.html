 One night, a fox met a wolf in the forest. The wolf was very hungry and in a terrible mood. So the wolf said to the fox.
 “Don’t move! I’m going to eat you this minute.”
 As he spoke, the wolf backed the fox up against a tree. The fox realized she could not run away.
 “I have to use my wits instead of my legs,” she said to herself.
 “I could have been a good dinner for you last year. I was then very fat and plump. But I had three babies then. Now I’m slim and not delicious.”
 “I don’t care if you are plump or not. I don’t care how many babies you have. I’m going to eat you right now!”
The wolf began closing in on the fox.
 “Stop!, the fox shouted. “ Look how skinny I am. I ran off all my fat looking for my babies. But I know a place where you can find something good and fat.”
 Wolf backed off and listened to Fox.
 “There is a well near here. In the bottom of it is a big round piece of meat. You can get it instead of eating me. Shall we go?”
 The wolf trotted off after the fox, making sure that she could not run away. They came upon a well.
 “See for yourself, what a fat juicy piece of meat is at the bottom of this well. I wanted to get it for my babies. But you can have it.”
 Inside the well was a delicious looking yellow round piece of meat. Above the well, the moon shone bright and clear. The wolf leaned over the well wondering how to get the piece of meat. The fox jumped up quickly and pushed the wolf down into the deep well.
 “ I’m a sly old mother Fox!” Fox said to herself.

The wolf began closing in on the fox.
 “Stop!, the fox shouted. “ Look how skinny I am. I ran off all my fat looking for my babies. But I know a place where you can find something good and fat.”
 Wolf backed off and listened to Fox.
 “There is a well near here. In the bottom of it is a big round piece of meat. You can get it instead of eating me. Shall we go?”

 “See for yourself, what a fat juicy piece of meat is at the bottom of this well. I wanted to get it for my babies. But you can have it.”
 Inside the well was a delicious looking yellow round piece of meat. Above the well, the moon shone bright and clear. The wolf leaned over the well wondering how to get the piece of meat. The fox jumped up quickly and pushed the wolf down into the deep well.
