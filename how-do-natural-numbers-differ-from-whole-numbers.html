                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. To find the answer, add the hour she spent on her Mathematics homework and Science homework.
</p><p>
</p><p>¾ + ⅞ (LCD: 8)
</p><p>
</p><p>= 6⁄8‌ + ⅞
</p><p>
</p><p>= ‌13⁄8‌ or 1 ⅝
</p><p>
</p><p>She spent 1 ⅝ hour on doing all her homework.
</p><p>2. To know the number of boys, subtract the number of girls which is ¾ of 60 from the total number of students. Remember that the word "of" means to multiply.
</p><p>
</p><p>60 - (¾ × 60)
</p><p>
</p><p>= 60 - 45
</p><p>
</p><p>= 15

</p><p>There are 15 boys.

</p><p>
</p><p>8 - (-2)
</p><p>
</p><p>= 8 + 2
</p><p>
</p><p>= 10

</p><p>The difference is 29,513 ft.
</p><p>5. To find the part of the yard that is left unclean, find the remaining part of the yard by subtracting the part that Angie cleans from the whole yard. Then, subtract the part that Alex cleans from it.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. No, all real numbers are not rational numbers because real numbers also contain irrational numbers.</p><p></p><p>2. No, a rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction. Whereas, a whole number is a positive number without a decimal or fractions. Every whole number is a rational number but every rational number is not a whole number.</p><p></p><p>3. *what is that "--- and --"?</p><p></p><p>4. Rational numbers are the numbers which are integers and fractions. On the other end, Irrational numbers are the numbers whose expression as a fraction is not possible. </p><p></p><p>5. The major difference between natural and whole numbers is that natural number doesn’t include 0 whereas whole numbers include 0 too.

Read the details about whole number in brainly.ph/question/2170601•     Addition of whole numbers always gives a whole number. Thus whole numbers are closed under addition.<p>            Eg. 5+7 = 12</p>•     Subtraction of whole numbers does not always give a whole number. Thus whole numbers are not closed under subtraction.<p>           Eg. 5-7 = -2, which is a negative integer and not a whole number.</p>•     Multiplication of whole numbers always gives a whole number. Thus whole numbers are closed under multiplication.<p>           Eg. 5x7 = 35</p>•      Dividing a whole number by another does not always give a whole number. Thus whole numbers are not closed under division.<p>           Eg. 5÷7 = a fraction, thus it will not be a whole number</p><p>Read the details about the example of whole number brainly.ph/question/1589930</p>What are Natural Numbers?<strong>Natural numbers </strong>are the set of positive integers, that is, integers from 1 to ∞ excluding fractional n decimal part.
