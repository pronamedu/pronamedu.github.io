Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users’ personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company’s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can’t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in America--even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman’s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge."

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                            7. What is World Literature?World literature is the totality of all national literatures. The formation of literature in different countries happened not at the same time, which is connected with the emergence of writing and artistic creativity.Each nation's literature has its own artistic and national features. World literature is very important for studying, still the literature of one country develops together with other national literatures. They enrich each other borrowing certain literary elements. There are a lot of scientific works on world literature, which explain the peculiarities of this phenomenon. As a concept, world literature emerged only in the 19th century when the literary connections of different countries had spread and strengthened.The term "world literature" was introduced by Jogann Wolfgang von Goethe. He used the word "Weltliteratur" in 1827. Goethe studied the characteristic features and interrelationships of different national literatures, the tendencies of their development and their achievements. He studied the works of famous writers awwhich presented different literary phenomena of different historic periods.He claimed that literature shouldn't be restrained by national boundaries. In 1894 the world saw the first book about world literature "The history of world literature. The world literature emerged because of the development of global economic and cultural relations.This global literary process was also caused by the rapid development of national literatures. In the history of world literature, we define several stages of its development such as the literature of Bronze Age, Classical literature, Early Medieval literature, Medieval literature, Early Modern and Modern literature.World literature is the cultural heritage of all humanity. It is essential to study world literature as it helps us understand the life of different people from all over the world, forms our world-outlook and acquaints us with the masterpieces of literature.QUESTION.1.

                            8. World literature is the totality of all national literatures. The formation of literature in different countries happened not at the same time, which is connected with the emergence of writing and artistic creativity.Each nation's literature has its own artistic and national features. World literature is very important for studying, still the literature of one country develops together with other national literatures. They enrich each other borrowing certain literary elements. There are a lot of scientific works on world literature, which explain the peculiarities of this phenomenon. As a concept, world literature emerged only in the 19th century when the literary connections of different countries had spread and strengthened.The term "world literature" was introduced by Jogann Wolfgang von Goethe. He used the word "Weltliteratur" in 1827. Goethe studied the characteristic features and interrelationships of different national literatures, the tendencies of their development and their achievements. He studied the works of famous writers awwhich presented different literary phenomena of different historic periods.He claimed that literature shouldn't be restrained by national boundaries. In 1894 the world saw the first book about world literature "The history of world literature. The world literature emerged because of the development of global economic and cultural relations.This global literary process was also caused by the rapid development of national literatures. In the history of world literature, we define several stages of its development such as the literature of Bronze Age, Classical literature, Early Medieval literature, Medieval literature, Early Modern and Modern literature.World literature is the cultural heritage of all humanity. It is essential to study world literature as it helps us understand the life of different people from all over the world, forms our world-outlook and acquaints us with the masterpieces of literature.QUESTION.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Literature, belles-lettres, letters refer to artistic writings worthy of being remembered. In the broadest sense, literature includes any type of writings on any subject: the literature of medicine; usually, however, it means the body of artistic writings of a country or period that are characterized by beauty of expression and form and by universality of intellectual and emotional appeal: English literature of the 16th century. Belles-lettres is a more specific term for writings of a light, elegant, or excessively refined character: His talent is not for scholarship but for belles-lettres. Letters (rare today outside of certain fixed phrases) refers to literature as a domain of study or creation: a man of letters.</p><br />

The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users’ personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company’s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can’t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in America--even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman’s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge."

                            14. IDENTIFICATION Identify the Theme of 21st
History
Narrative
Century Literature based from the statement
7. As contemporary readers are able to look back and see how it has been depicted differently for different audiences, these have become themes in 21st century literature. Often contemporary literature explores the notion of multiplicities of truth and acknowledges that it is filtered through human perspective and experience.
8. Today, this is more integrated into people’s lives than ever before. Dreams of what this could potentially help people become and anxieties regarding the demise of humanity as a result of this can be seen in 21st century literature.
9. In postmodern style, many contemporary writers recognize a piece of work as being one among many throughout history. As such, many writers purposely include acknowledgements, references or parallels to other works of fiction, recognizing their place in a larger, broader conversation, context and body of work. Some themes go as far as to poke fun at a work’s own lack of originality or the clichés that it seemingly cannot escape.
10. With increasing globalization, intersections of cultures and more vocal discussions of women’s rights and LGBT rights, it has become a common theme in 21st century literature. In a world that is now able to exchange ideas more quickly than ever before via the Internet and other technological advancements, people have relatively more freedom to draw from multiple cultures and philosophies and question the concept of the self and its relation to the body, brain and “soul.</h2><br />

How can literature "shake" mountains and give "vast delight" to us?​ PLS ANSWER IT I REALLY NEED IT NOW​</h2><br />
                        1. The first three lines of "Boating Song" by Li Po reveal that the persona may come from a lower socio-economic status. The image of "a small boat" suggests that the persona may not have access to larger and more expensive boats. The image of "a tattered sail" implies that the boat is old and may not have been well-maintained due to financial constraints. These images suggest that the persona may not have the same resources as others who can afford more luxurious boats. His state of mind may be one of contentment and appreciation for what he has, rather than dissatisfaction or envy for what he does not have.<br /><br />2. The persona's attitude towards life, as seen in lines 4 and 6, is one of acceptance and embracing of the present moment. He is not worried about the future or regretful of the past. This attitude is related to Taoism, the philosophy of the author Li Po, which emphasizes living in harmony with the natural world and living in the present moment without judgment or attachment to outcomes.<br /><br />3. In comparison to the persona, my personality may differ in terms of my level of contentment and appreciation for what I have. I may have a tendency to compare myself to others or feel a sense of dissatisfaction if I don't have the same resources or opportunities. However, like the persona, I do believe in living in the present moment and embracing what life has to offer.<br /><br />4. "The songs of Chu-ping" and "the Ch'u kings" refer to classical Chinese historical figures and places. Chu-ping was a famous musician in the Han Dynasty, known for his compositions and performances. The Ch'u kings were rulers of the Ch'u state during the Warring States period in China. The Han River is a significant river in China, flowing through multiple provinces and playing a key role in Chinese history. These references indicate that the persona is likely familiar with classical Chinese history and culture.<br /><br />5. In lines 10-12, the persona is saying that poetry and literature have the power to move us and bring us immense joy. Literature can "shake" mountains, implying that it has the power to move even the most immovable objects. It can also bring us "vast delight," suggesting that literature has the power to give us immense pleasure and satisfaction. These lines show the persona's appreciation for the power of literature and its ability to connect us to the world around us.<br />
