                        <p>  This love story is very unlike those we see in movies or read about in modern romance novels. Both Ruth and Boaz acted with consistency and propriety. Each showed kindness and respect for the other. Both of them were completely open and sincere about their commitment to Jehovah and His promises to Israel. Neither was interested in romance as recreation or abstraction.</p><p> Boaz admired Ruth from their first encounter, but he understood the legal hurdle that would stand in the way of courtship and refused to be presumptuous. He was also sensitive to the difference in their respective ages. He waited honorably for some sort of encouragement from Ruth and Naomi. Ruth could have pursued romance with someone younger and more exciting. She chose instead to submit to the pattern of the covenant life she had adopted. She chose to propose to Boaz because he was a proper kinsman-redemeer because her mother-in-law advised it and because he was kind and honorable and godly.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>We hear this for the first time from Boaz. He makes an announcement to all those assembled at the gate that is usually translated, "Naomi is selling the parcel of land that belonged to their relative Elimelech." Boaz asks the unnamed man (another relative) if he wants to buy it, and surprisingly, the individual does. It seems pretty straightforward until one remembers that Naomi and Ruth have been living like paupers ever since they returned from Moab. When Naomi came into the city of Bethlehem, she complained that she had been brought back empty. Now we're supposed to understand that she's been sitting on some property this whole time?

He is not only involved in business but he participates in various outdoor activities. He plays golf, basketball and loves partying with friends at night. In his mid-30’s Boaz has had several romantic relationships wherein he got himself having Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Due to this life-threatening infection and illness, he later on died. Several days later one of Boaz’s friends who attended his funeral, awfully saw him (Boaz) waving his hand from afar. It was later known that Boaz was indifferent to this said friend when he was still alive.  Point to Ponder:  Cite a genuine experience or theory that would collaborate with what we discussed in class especially concerning the afterlife as in the case of Boaz. Moreover, how do you see “THE SELF” as it exits this world​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The theory of reincarnation is one genuine experience that could collaborate with what we discussed in class concerning the afterlife as in the case of Boaz. According to this belief, the soul of an individual passes through a cycle of rebirths or different lives, after death. This can be seen as a way for the soul to progress and reach a higher understanding or level of being, or simply to learn from previous mistakes. As far as “THE SELF” is concerned, depending on one’s beliefs, THE SELF may not even exist after physical death, or it may continue existing in a different form. Ultimately, what happens to THE SELF after death is a subject of much debate and ultimately comes down to how one perceives existence and the afterlife.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One theory that could be relevant to Boaz's case is the concept of the near-death experience (NDE). NDEs are subjective experiences that some people report having after being pronounced clinically dead or coming close to death. These experiences can include feelings of peace, detachment from the body, a tunnel or bright light, and encounters with deceased loved ones or spiritual beings.</p><p></p><p>Some researchers and philosophers have argued that NDEs offer evidence for the survival of consciousness after death. They suggest that NDEs provide proof that there is an afterlife and that the self can exist beyond the physical body. However, this remains a controversial topic in scientific and philosophical circles.</p><p></p><p>In terms of how the self exits this world, there are various philosophical perspectives. Some argue that the self is simply a product of the brain, and therefore, when the brain ceases to function, the self ceases to exist. Others suggest that the self is more than just the physical body and that it may continue to exist in some form after death, such as in the form of a soul or consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the question of what happens to the self after death remains a mystery, and various theories and beliefs exist to try and make sense of it.</p><br />

                            23. ➜ Why did Ruth and Orpah make a different decision? ੭​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>In Ruth 1, we read that the husband of Naomi died in the land of Moab. Naomi’s two sons, the husbands of Ruth and Orpah, also died. Naomi then chose to return to Israel and encouraged her daughters-in-law to return to their families. In verse 8 she says, “Go back, each of you, to your mother’s home. May the Lord show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me.”</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>In Ruth 1, we read that the husband of Naomi died in the land of Moab.

May the Lord show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me.”Initially, both Ruth and Orpah refused, saying, “We will go back with you to your people” (Ruth 1:10). Naomi then argued that she could provide no more husbands for Ruth and Orpah. From Naomi’s perspective, Ruth and Orpah would remain widowed and childless unless they returned to the homes of their parents. After Naomi’s continued encouragement, Orpah agreed and returned to her family (Ruth 1:14).</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>In Ruth 1, we read that the husband of Naomi died in the land of Moab.

Go back with her” (Ruth 1:15). Ruth’s response revealed the difference between Orpah and herself. Ruth said, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me” (Ruth 1:16–17).</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
