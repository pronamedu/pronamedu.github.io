                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are many reasons why you should eat breakfast before going to school. </p><p></p><p>The first reason is that you need food for energy. You have been sleeping all night, and your body is running on empty. Eating breakfast will help you to have the energy you need to learn and concentrate in school.</p><p></p><p>The second reason is that eating breakfast helps you to maintain a healthy weight. If you skip breakfast and go to school on an empty stomach, you are more likely to make unhealthy food choices later in the day. Eating breakfast will help you to avoid overeating later in the day.</p><p></p><p>The third reason is that eating breakfast helps you to start your day off right. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and it sets the tone for the rest of the day. If you start your day with a healthy breakfast, you are more likely to make healthy choices throughout the day.</p><p></p><p>So, make sure to eat breakfast before you go to school! It will help you to concentrate, maintain a healthy weight, and start your day off right.</p><p><strong>INFORMATIVE </strong><strong>SPEECH</strong></p><p><strong>[tex]__________________________________[/tex]</strong></p><p><strong>A lecture given by a teacher in a high school or college class is an example of an informative speech.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>All around the world, smoking has long been a habit. However, smoking cigarettes used to be quite common, well-known as a hip recreational substance, and widely accepted by society worldwide. Due to the numerous health concerns associated with smoking, smoking is less prevalent and more limited nowadays. People are more educated and aware of the dangers of smoking now than ever before. As a result, smoking's appeal has drastically decreased during the previous ten years. Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is more than just an addiction. You can lose approximately 13.8 minutes of your life for every cigarette you smoke. You can lose about 4.6 hours of your life for every pack of cigarettes you smoke. Smoking is expensive, although many of us may not be aware of this or pay attention to it.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I thinks this is already around 700 words srry..</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>“Here, try these on.” She slides the crimson, velvet curtain of a changing room open and hangs the dresses on a rack tucked inside, and pushes me inside before closing the curtain behind me. “I’ll be right here if you need me.” I stand, awestruck before the many-coloured dresses. Gingerly, I reach out to caress the fabrics with my fingertips. Each dress has a soft touch, even the silk ones. After admiring the clothes, I select a simple, turquoise, crepe dress with squared shoulders that cuts in close at the waist. As I stand before the mirror, I hold it against myself and gasp in horror. It will conceal my chest, but will leave the entire length of my legs bare. With the slightest movement, my panties will be on display. I can't possibly wear this, not only because of my scars but my dignity. In repulsion, I slam the dress back onto the rack and select the next one, a black, leather dress that appears extremely tight. Oh yes, I'm sure the corset style bodice will hold everything in place, including my ribcage. </p><p></p><br />

                            8. What is the importance of reading comprehension in college students 500-600 words</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reading comprehension is an important skill for college students to develop in order to be successful in their courses. It is the ability to understand, process, and remember the information that is read. Reading comprehension is a foundational skill that is required to understand and interact with the written material that is presented in college courses. Without this skill, college students will struggle to keep up with their coursework and could find themselves unable to fully comprehend and absorb the content presented in their classes.</p><p></p><p>Reading comprehension involves a variety of skills including decoding, understanding and applying the material that is read, and making connections between what is read and the student’s own experiences, knowledge, and beliefs. Decoding refers to the ability to accurately read, pronounce, and understand the words that are written on the page. Understanding the material involves having the ability to identify the main ideas, draw conclusions, and make inferences based on what is being read. Applying the material means being able to relate the information to real-world situations, and making connections between the material and the student’s own experiences, knowledge, and beliefs.</p><p></p><p>Improving reading comprehension can be achieved through practice and repetition. One way to do this is to read the material multiple times, and to pay close attention to the details. Taking notes while reading can also be beneficial, as it allows students to record their understanding of the material and to review it later. Additionally, engaging in activities such as asking questions, summarizing the material, and discussing it with peers can also help to improve reading comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Good reading comprehension skills are also important for college students in order to be successful when taking exams.

                        <p>Nonviolence is the personal practice of not causing harm to one's self and others under every condition. It may come from the belief that hurting people, animals and/or the environment is unnecessary to achieve an outcome and it may refer to a general philosophy of abstention from violence. It may be based on moral, religious or spiritual principles, but also the reasons for it may be purely strategic or pragmatic.[Nonviolence has "active" or "activist" elements, in that believers generally accept the need for nonviolence as a means to achieve political and social change. Thus, for example, Tolstoyan and Gandhism nonviolence is both a philosophy and strategy for social change that rejects the use of violence, but at the same time it sees nonviolent action (also called civil resistance) as an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or armed struggle against it. In general, advocates of an activist philosophy of nonviolence use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, mass noncooperation, civil disobedience, nonviolent direct action, and social, political, cultural and economic forms of intervention.</p><br />

                            13. Relevance and Impact of MIND MAPPING (600 words)</h2><br />
                        <p>Mind mapping is a powerful technique that has been used for decades to help individuals organize their thoughts, ideas, and information. It is a visual representation of concepts, ideas, and their relationships that allows learners to connect ideas and create a mental map of a topic. Mind mapping has become increasingly popular in recent years, and its relevance and impact are evident in many different fields.</p><p>In education, mind mapping is a commonly used tool that helps students to organize their thoughts, make connections between concepts, and create a visual representation of their understanding. It is particularly effective for visual learners who need to see the relationships between ideas to fully comprehend a topic. Mind mapping can be used in many different subject areas, including science, math, language arts, and social studies, and it can be applied to a wide range of learning tasks, including note-taking, brainstorming, and problem-solving.</p><p>One of the key benefits of mind mapping is its ability to help learners retain information. By creating a visual representation of a topic, learners are more likely to remember key concepts and ideas, as well as the relationships between them. This can be particularly helpful for students who struggle with memorization or who have difficulty retaining information through traditional methods.</p><p>Another important benefit of mind mapping is its ability to promote creativity and critical thinking. By allowing learners to connect ideas and create new associations between concepts, mind mapping can help students to generate new ideas and perspectives, and to think more critically about a topic. This can be particularly valuable in fields like art, design, and innovation, where creativity and problem-solving skills are essential.</p><p>Mind mapping is also a valuable tool in business and industry. It can be used to help individuals and teams to brainstorm new ideas, plan projects, and manage information. By creating a visual representation of a project or idea, teams can more easily communicate their ideas and collaborate on solutions. This can be particularly helpful for remote teams or teams that work across different departments or locations.</p><p>In addition to its benefits in education and business, mind mapping has also been used in therapy and counseling. It can be an effective tool for individuals who are struggling with mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression. By creating a visual representation of their thoughts and emotions, individuals can better understand their own thinking patterns and identify areas of concern. This can help to promote self-awareness and facilitate the development of coping strategies.</p><p>Overall, the impact of mind mapping on individuals and society is significant. It is a powerful tool that can help individuals to organize their thoughts, make connections between concepts, and generate new ideas. Whether in education, business, or therapy, mind mapping has proven to be an effective tool for promoting creativity, critical thinking, and self-awareness.</p><p>In conclusion, mind mapping is a relevant and impactful tool that has the potential to transform the way we think, learn, and communicate. Its ability to help individuals organize their thoughts, make connections between concepts, and generate new ideas makes it a valuable tool in many different fields, including education, business, and therapy. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that mind mapping will continue to play an important role in helping individuals to navigate the complex world around them.</p><br />

                            16. media and information literacy as tool for civic responsibility and nation building 600 word​</h2><br />
                        <p>Media and information literacy (MIL) is an essential tool for promoting civic responsibility and nation building in the modern era. In today's digital age, media and information are more ubiquitous than ever before, and the ability to critically analyze, evaluate, and interpret this content is critical for responsible citizenship and national development. By fostering MIL skills, individuals and communities can become more informed, engaged, and active participants in the democratic process, promoting social and economic development and advancing national goals.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary benefits of MIL is that it promotes critical thinking and analysis skills, which are essential for evaluating the accuracy and validity of information. In an era of "fake news" and misinformation, the ability to distinguish between credible and unreliable sources is critical for making informed decisions and participating in the democratic process. MIL skills enable individuals to assess the accuracy of information, identify bias and propaganda, and develop informed opinions and beliefs.</p><p></p><p>Another benefit of MIL is that it can help promote digital citizenship, which is becoming increasingly important as technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Digital citizenship involves responsible use of technology and online media, as well as respect for privacy, intellectual property, and digital rights. By promoting media and information literacy skills among young people, countries can help foster a new generation of digital citizens who are equipped to navigate the complexities of the digital world and use technology for positive social and economic outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, MIL skills enable individuals to become more engaged and active citizens, empowering them to participate more fully in the democratic process. By understanding how media and information are created, distributed, and consumed, individuals can become more effective advocates and stakeholders, using their knowledge and skills to advocate for their communities, hold leaders accountable, and promote social and economic development.</p><p></p><p>In addition to its civic benefits, MIL also has significant economic benefits for national development. By promoting media and information literacy skills, countries can develop a more informed and skilled workforce, which is critical for economic growth and innovation. In today's knowledge-based economy, the ability to analyze and interpret information is essential for success in virtually every industry, and MIL skills can provide a competitive advantage for individuals and businesses alike.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, MIL can help foster a more transparent and accountable government, which is essential for promoting economic development and social progress. By promoting media and information literacy among government officials and civil society organizations, countries can promote greater transparency, accountability, and citizen participation, which can help reduce corruption, promote the rule of law, and stimulate economic growth.</p><p></p><p>Finally, MIL can help promote cultural diversity and understanding by exposing individuals to a wide range of perspectives and viewpoints. By promoting media and information literacy skills among individuals from diverse backgrounds, countries can help foster greater cultural understanding and respect, which can reduce social tensions and promote social cohesion. This can be particularly important in countries with diverse populations, where intercultural dialogue and understanding are essential for promoting peaceful coexistence and social progress.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, media and information literacy is an essential tool for promoting civic responsibility and nation building in today's digital age. By fostering critical thinking, promoting citizen engagement, and empowering individuals and communities with knowledge and skills, MIL can help build stronger, more resilient societies that are better equipped to address the complex challenges of the 21st century. Whether through formal education programs, community-based initiatives, or public-private partnerships, promoting media and information literacy is a critical investment in the future of our societies and economies.</p><p></p><p>brainliest pls ^^ ty</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The kulintang ensemble is important to the people of mindanao because it comes from the association with the indigenous cultures living on the islands before the influence of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity or the West, making it the most advanced tradition of southern Asian Asian archaic gong-chime ensembles.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><p>Kulintang is a modern term for an ancient instrumental form of music consisting of a row of small, horizontally laid gongs that function melodically, accompanied by larger, suspended gongs and drums. As part of the larger gong-chime culture of Southeast Asia, kulintang music groups have played for centuries in the regions of East Indonesia, the Southern Philippines, East Malaysia, Brunei and Timor. Kulintang evolved from a simple tradition of signaling indigenous, and developed in its present form with the inclusion of knobbed gongs from the Sundanese people on Java Island, Indonesia.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student, my online learning experience has been even busier compared to attending regular classes on campus in person because for the most part, I am not taking it as seriously as I need to take it. However, what I like about learning online is that I’m not as pressured to present myself as an excellent student, I can relax more, as well as think more (and I mean really THINK) because, in a school environment, I, as well as other students have to pace ourselves to think, which for most of us causes stress and anxiety. What I don’t like about online learning is that it can take me up to a whole school day (6-7 hours) to finish two assignments at most, given to me by my teachers. Comparing to my experience as a student in a physical classroom, online learning is definitely harder because I and maybe other students (even the independent people that like working by themselves) are so used to working with other students. If I could choose from wanting to do more online learning in the future, I will not because, although I’m the independent type, the vibe of learning online at home is just not the same as in a classroom with other students.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#Cary on learning. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Crime is a major issue that affects individuals, communities, and society as a whole. It can take many forms, from violent crimes such as murder and assault, to property crimes such as theft and vandalism, to white collar crimes such as fraud and embezzlement. Regardless of the type of crime, it can have serious and lasting consequences for victims, offenders, and the community at large.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant consequences of crime is the fear and insecurity it can create. Victims of crime may experience physical harm, emotional trauma, and financial loss. They may also feel unsafe in their own homes and communities, which can lead to decreased quality of life and reduced trust in law enforcement and government. Communities with high crime rates may also experience a decline in property values, an increase in population turnover, and a decrease in business and economic activity.</p><p></p><p>Offenders also face serious consequences as a result of their actions. They may be incarcerated, pay fines and restitution, or be subject to community supervision. The criminal justice system is designed to hold offenders accountable for their actions and protect society from further harm, but it is not always effective in achieving these goals. The system can also be costly, both in terms of financial resources and the impact on offenders and their families.</p><p></p><p>Preventing crime and addressing its underlying causes is crucial to reducing its impact on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. This can involve a variety of strategies, such as increasing community engagement and involvement, providing education and job training opportunities, addressing social and economic inequality, and improving access to mental health and substance abuse services.</p><p></p><p>One of the most effective ways of preventing crime is by addressing the root causes such as poverty, lack of education, and unemployment. These issues can lead to a feeling of hopelessness and desperation, which in turn can lead to criminal behavior. By addressing these underlying issues, we can help to reduce crime rates and create safer and more prosperous communities.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of preventing crime is community engagement and involvement. Strong and healthy communities are less likely to experience high crime rates. By encouraging residents to get involved in their communities, we can help to build stronger, safer, and more resilient neighborhoods. This can include volunteering, participating in neighborhood watch programs, or simply getting to know your neighbors.</p><p></p><p>Education and job training opportunities can also play a key role in preventing crime. Education helps to provide individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce, which can in turn help to reduce poverty and unemployment. Job training can help to provide individuals with the skills and experience they need to find and maintain employment, which can lead to increased self-sufficiency and a sense of purpose.</p><p></p><p>Access to mental health and substance abuse services is also an important aspect of preventing crime. Mental health and substance abuse issues can contribute to criminal behavior, and addressing these issues can help to reduce crime rates. By providing individuals with access to mental health and substance abuse services, we can help to reduce the number of people who engage in criminal behavior.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, crime is a serious issue that affects individuals, communities, and society as a whole. Addressing its underlying causes, such as poverty, lack of education, and unemployment, and promoting community engagement, education and job training opportunities, access to mental health and substance abuse services are important strategies for preventing crime and creating safer communities. It is important to work together as a society to address this issue and make our communities safer for everyone.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>HAPPY TO HELP</strong><strong>!</strong></p><br />

Children of highly paid individuals are more likely to be highly paid and children of low paid individuals are more likely to be low earners. Key research findings include:</p><p></p><p>Countries with higher levels of income inequality have lower levels of social mobility[1]:Research indicates that the link between inequality and a lack of social mobility exists throughout a person’s life. Higher inequality is associated with lower social mobility when looking at both children and adults. Such links are stronger than the link between social mobility and poverty[2].</p><p>Critics of this relationship have suggested that groups with bigger differences between them will always have lower rates of mobility, whether that is in groups of chess players with different skill levels or people in countries with different levels of inequality[3].

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My philosophy on life is that you should live while you are alive and you should give others that same privilege. We shouldn't judge people for the choices they make, because we all make bad decisions. You should do what you want with your life, as long as it makes you happy and causes no harm to others.</p><br />

                            29. parents must educate their children on the use of condoms even at an early age 600 words essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The use of condoms has been known to be a reliable form of contraception for many years. However, in recent years, the use of condoms has become even more important for the protection of sexual health. Unfortunately, many parents are hesitant to talk to their children about the use of condoms, particularly at an early age. It is essential for parents to educate their children on the use of condoms as early as possible, as this will not only help prevent unwanted pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, but also help create an environment of openness and understanding between parent and child.</p><p></p><p>The first step in teaching children about condoms is to start the conversation at an early age. It is important to explain the concept of condoms to children in a way that they can understand. Parents can start by talking to their children about the importance of protecting themselves and their partners. As children grow older, parents can provide more detailed information about the different types of condoms, how to use them, and the importance of using them consistently and correctly.</p><p></p><p>In addition to providing information about condoms, it is also important for parents to be supportive and understanding when it comes to their children’s decisions about sex and contraception. Parents should be willing to talk to their children about their thoughts and feelings about sex, and listen to their concerns without judgment. It is also important for parents to emphasize the importance of using condoms, not only for the protection of their child’s health, but also for the health of their partners.</p><p></p><p>Parents should also be aware of the availability of condoms in their community. Condoms should be available in local pharmacies and health centers, and parents should encourage their children to make use of these resources. In addition, parents should ensure that their children understand the importance of using condoms for all types of sexual activity, including oral, anal and vaginal intercourse.</p><p></p><p>Finally, parents should also take the time to discuss the potential consequences of unprotected sex. This includes the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned pregnancies, and the potential emotional and financial implications of having an unplanned pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it is essential for parents to educate their children on the use of condoms, even at an early age. By providing accurate information, being supportive and understanding, and emphasizing the importance of using condoms consistently and correctly, parents can help ensure that their children are protected and make informed decisions about their sexual health.</p><p></p><br />
