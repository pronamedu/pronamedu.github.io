                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. ... Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.</p><p></p><p>2. Due to high temperature and the surrounding bodies of water, the Philippines has a high relative humidity. ...</p><p></p><p>3. Learning about the seasons helps children understand the passage of time and teaches them about change. While some seasonal changes are more obvious (like changes in the weather), there are many important subtle differences related to each season, like changes in the type of food that is available.</p><p></p><p>4. The four seasons only happen in the regions along the mid-latitude— places that are neither near the poles nor near the equator. ... The Philippines is a tropical country, and has only two official seasons– wet and dry.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning☁️-linethcaturan☁️<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) A season is a period of the year that is distinguished by special climate conditions. The four seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter—follow one another regularly. Each has its own light, temperature, and weather patterns that repeat yearly.</p><p></p><p>2) Using temperature and rainfall as bases, the climate of the country can be divided into two major seasons: (1) the rainy season, from June to November; and (2) the dry season, from December to May.</p><p></p><p>3) Dry season in the Philippines spans from November through to May, and these months are considered the best time of year to visit this tropical archipelago. It's worth bearing in mind that temperatures and humidity levels are particularly high in April &amp; May.</p><p></p><p>4) The climate of the country is divided into two main seasons: the rainy season, from June to the early part of October; the dry season, from the later part of October to May.</p><br />

                        <p>1. The activities depicted in picture A are the activities that are commonly done during wet season like planting rice and because of heavy rains, the streets were flooded. In picture B, the activities depicted are the activities that are commonly done during dry seasons like going into an adventure like zip lining and hiking.</p><p>2. Like what I've said on the number 1, Picture A portrays Wet Season and picture B portrays Dry season.</p><p>3. Wet season is basically due to typhoons that's why it is wet and the activities you can do is limited while in dry season, this is the season where you can go to an adventure, do everything you want. </p><p>4. I prefer dry season over wet season because as I've said, the activities that you can do in wet season is only limited but in dry season, you can do whatever you want to do. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A season is a division of the year based on changes in weather, ecology, and the number of daylight hours in a given region. On Earth, seasons are the result of Earth's orbit around the Sun and Earth's axial tilt relative to the ecliptic plane. </p><p>2.Using temperature and rainfall as bases, the climate of the country can be divided into two major seasons: (1) the rainy season, from June to November; and (2) the dry season, from December to May</p><p>3.

This is also dependent on location in the country as some areas experience rain all throughout the year.</p><p>5.Because the Philippines is near the equator.</p><p>6.Learning about the seasons helps children understand the passage of time and teaches them about change. While some seasonal changes are more obvious (like changes in the weather), there are many important subtle differences related to each season, like changes in the type of food that is available.</p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps ☺️</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>one of the four periods of the year (spring, summer, autumn, and winter), beginning astronomically at an equinox or solstice, but geographically at different dates in different climates.There are two seasons in the country, the wet season and the dry season, (1) the rainy season, from June to November; and (2) the dry season, from December to May.<strong>Dry Season</strong>bikingHiking / mountaineering.Enjoying the beach<p><strong>Wet Season</strong></p>playing board gamesbadminton volleyball<p></p><p>4. There are two major factors affecting the seasonal change globally: the High Pressure Area (HPA), which originates from colder regions, and the Low Pressure Area (LPA), which propagates mainly in warmer regions. Those gigantic pressure zones in the Philippines are crucial to determining our tropical climate.</p><p></p><p>5. The Philippines is located near the equator. Areas near or at the equator receive high amounts of sunlight due to the inclination of the earth. Because more amount of sunlight is received in these areas, there are only two seasons here: the summer and the rainy season.</p><p></p><p>6.

                        1. The first season is spring. The second season is summer. The third season is autumn. The fourth season is winter. And the cycle restarts.<br /><br />2. Seasons are changes in temperature and weather. These are caused due to the imperfect axis of the earth. Just because of the imperfection of the earth, causes it to make beautiful weather patterns. Because of this, people enjoy the creation of mother earth.<br /><br />3. The 1st season is spring. It is where flowers bloom and plants sprout. The 2nd season is summer. It is where everything outside is hot enought to cook an egg! (True fact) The 3rd season is autumn. A season where bright orange and crimson leaves fall, preparing for the 4th season, which is winter. Winter is the jolly, happy and snowy christmas season, where people throw snowballs and enjoy eachother.<br /><br />for number 4, its up to u! ^^<br />
