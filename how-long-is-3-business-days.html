                                            Dagger (Patalim)
by Cirilo Baustista (translated by J.A. Del Prado)
Day by day
my wife and I try
the sharpness
of our dagger.
For instance
when my youngest child
is crying
and my beloved
does not move
I stab her back
and merrily
watch her
nurse the child
while she bleeds.
If the light bulb is burned out
in our kitchen
and I am busy
writing a poem,
she never stops
stabbing me on the nape
as long as the light is
not replaced.
Our fight is fair
a fault is a fault, no
cheating.
That’s why
by the day’s end
we count
the
wounds
and the seemingly ragged souls
will laugh
and punch each other.
We are always like this since
our love for each other
is more than enough.

If you lead a busy life, you are probably not getting enough vitamin C. Given the choice, most of us would rather relax with a cup of coffee, instead of peeling an orange. (1 )__________, the cold and flu season is not over yet. Especially at this time of the year, vitamin C is not just a necessity, but essential for helping maintain the immune system. (2) __________ the experts’ acknowledgement that there is no real substitute for real fruit, our company discovered a new way to maximize the benefits of taking a daily dose of vitamin C. Redaxon makes this possible with a capsule.( 3) __________ an orange a day may give the body a sudden burst of vitamin C, the effects do not last long- no matter how it is consumed. Vitamin C cannot be stored in the body for a long period of time (4) __________ its solubility in water. So, how does Redaxon Slow Release Work? Each capsule contains hundreds of coated pellets made up of Vitamin C. These pellets dissolve safely and gradually into your system; (5)__________, they provide a continuous and steady source of vitamin C over a period of eight hours. This will help you to maintain the body’s natural defenses and resistance to infection.

when my youngest child

and my beloved

I stab her back
and merrily
watch her
nurse the child
while she bleeds.
If the light bulb is burned out
in our kitchen
and I am busy
writing a poem,
she never stops
stabbing me on the nape
as long as the light is
not replaced.
Our fight is fair
a fault is a fault, no
cheating.
That’s why
by the day’s end
we count
the
wounds
and the seemingly ragged souls
will laugh
and punch each other.
We are always like this since
our love for each other
is more than enough.
