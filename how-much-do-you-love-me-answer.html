                                            Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

Among the bees, Savy was the most popular of all because of his friendliness.He greeted everybody with a smile. Savy: Hi there! Hello! Savy addressed almost everyone. Savy: How are you doing? he asked Devy: im happy to see you again, Savy! replied Devy Devy: Your smile made my day she further said Savy is a helpfull bee Savy: Let me help you sip that honey Savy said Livy: sure! Thank you very much. I will easily finish my job Aside from being helpful, Savy got an award from the queen as the most obedient bee too. Queen Bee: Guard our bee hive tonight, Savy The queen commanded him Savy: Yes i will my queen Savy respectfully answered. However, among the bees , Chevy was the only one who was not convinced Savy's genuine friendliness Chevy: i don't think Savy is being true to everyone. I know he has motive to be the queen's first soldier He angrily said to himself. One day, while other bees were collecting nectar from flowers to flowers, Chevy was assigned that day to protect the bee hive. A group of hive beetles attacked the beehive where Chevy served as the soldier of the day Leader Beetle: Hey you little bee! Get out of our way! Give us your sweet honey! the leader of the hive beetle shouted. Chevy was so scared that he didn't even move a bit. Savy saw the whole scenario. He immediately flew towards the hive beetles and with all his might, he stung them beetles: Ouch! What are you doing? the enemies cowardly shouted. A swarm of bees quickly responded against the enemies, the hive beetles escaped from the raging bees Chevy: can we talk for a minute Savy? asked Chevy savy: Are you ok? What is it? tell me replied Savy Chevy: i'm sorry because all this time i have an ill feeling towards you Chevy answered Savy: huh? what did i do to hurt you? asked Savy Chevy: Noting, it is just that i envy you because everybody loves you Chevy sadly replied Savy: That's alright. Don't worry, we can be friends! From then on, Savy and Chevy became the closest friends ever. They were the friendliest bees in the Lala LandTitle?character?settings?theme?mood?conflict?plot?​</a>

                                            What's new Pandemic alertEmpowering CommunityThe fear, anxiety, grief and worry during and after a stressful situation can be overwhelming to people and the community. But out of crisis comes an outpouring of response to provide support for mental and well-being of those who are vulnerable and people in the Frontline during and after the covid-19 outbreak. it is hard to fight a battle when you cannot see the enemy. this is what makes everything so hard in this crisis we face. the lawmakers are lost with what to do. it's a hit &amp; miss situation when it comes to implementing guidelines. but there are so many people affected with the loss of jobs. the inability to earn a living, dependence in government subsidy and resources, which is so finite and scarce. so the vulnerable population has grown even more vulnerable and now, even the middle class are affected. as a humanitarian responder, I know I have to do something and I know I can do more. quarantine is not a hindrance. What gives you hope. My faith in God keeps me going. I Know that I have a God greater than all og these elements put together. My love for him inspires and pushes me to do my work and do this for others. Believeng also in the strength of local communities and partners gives me hope.kwowing that they also willing to be part of the solution. Helping the duty bearers by sharing the feedback of the valnerable sector. The idea of being able to help means i am able to effect others too. I feel good and I am able to breathe better knowing I can continue to help as much as I can. My advice : keep hope alive.

                                             The next week Mother become very ill.She was rushed to the hospital. I was allowed to see her only after a day Father said she was too weak to even speak. When l come in her hospital room i saw her hugging a doll . An awfully ugly little doll binked several times and raised its slimy little  hands to Mother. My Mother. What's THAT?lwrinkled my nose in disgust. Why honey, she's your little baby sister. You are a big brother now! And she hugged up again! Yuck My lips curled and i ran out out of the room. I wiped the tears that rolled down my cheeks. I was jealous. My father found me and scolded me. He said I should go and apologize to Mother for upsetting her After some spanking. I obeyed. I went book to her room "You're a liar. - you told me you love me. I do, sweetie.. Then, why? Aren't shouted at Mother. you happy you have a sister to play with a now "No." And that was that, Mother tried hard to establish ties between the ugly doll and me. But really don't ike it. 's no fun at all, not like Mother, I can't cimb trees, it can't run fast, it wets the bed it keeps on crying every time it trips and.it's always with Mother. It's stealing Mother away from me. Mother had two more ugly dolls the next year. She said they're "eye-dental things. Maybe because their eyes and teeth look the same. In fact, they looked like so much that I can't tell one ugly doll from another. I often saw Mother take different colored stones. Father said it should stop Mother from making more ugly dolls. But I didn't think that it worked because in the next seven years, nine screaming ugly dolls, some with long hair, others with short hair, surrounded me. Some are colored like chocolates, others milky, and still some are the color of coffee. There are thin ums and fat 'ums. but all of them are annoyingly noisy. And unbearably ugly, They even drool like my dog. Tagpi. I despised them all and I promised myself that when I grow up. i would develop a medicine to stop mothers from having ugly dolls. The witch doctors and faith healers in our town couldn't stop Mother from moking ugly dols. but I will. And now have grown up. In my quest to stop mothers from making ugly babies (my father threatened to stop me from schooling if i continue calling Mother's girls as ugly dolls. so now! call them ugly babies instead). I ended up in medical school. I become on obstetrician-gynecologist. I'm on my way to the delivery room for my first time to deliver an ugly baby. I still loathe babies. Ugly dolls that they are. Five hours later, I tapped the back of the newborn and a cry is heard. I stared at the helpless thing not realizing that tears are rolling down my cheeks again. This time, I smiled.

                                            Once upon a time, there lived a big mango tree. A little boy loved to come and play around it every day. He climbed to the tree top, ate the mangoes, took a nap under the shadow... He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him. Time went by, the little boy grew, and he no longer played around the tree. One day, the boy came back to the tree with a sad look on his face. "Come and play with me," the tree asked the boy. "I am no longer a kid, I don't play around trees anymore." The boy replied, "I want toys. I need money to buy them." "Sorry, I don't have money... but you can pick all my mangoes and sell them so you will have money." The boy was so excited. He picked all the mangoes on the tree and left happily. The boy didn't come back. The tree was sad. One day, the boy grown into a man returned. The tree was so excited. "Come and play with me," the tree said. "I don't have time to play. I have to work for my family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?" "Sorry, I don't have a house, but you can chop off my branches to build your house." So the man cut all the branches off the tree and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the boy didn't come back afterward. The tree was again lonely and sad. One hot summer day, the man returned and the tree was delighted. "Come and play with me!" The tree said. "I am sad and getting old. I want to go sailing to relax myself. Can you give me a boat?" "Use my trunk to build your boat. You can sail far away and be happy." So the man cut the tree trunk to make a boat. He went sailing and didn't come back for a long time. Finally, the man returned after he had been gone for so many years. "Sorry, my boy, but I don't have anything for you anymore. No more mangoes to give you." The tree said. "I don't have teeth to bite," the man replied. "No more trunk for you to climb on." "I am too old for that now," the man said. "I really can't give you anything, the only thing left is my dying roots," the tree said with sadness. "I don't need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all these years," the man replied. "Good! Old tree roots are the best place to lean on and rest. Come sit down with me and rest." The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled.

An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind
aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making
decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it
should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas
which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine
several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the SAME SEX MARRIAGE that
is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals.
Father Nael: (Priest)
It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a
sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the
commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.

Mr. Serge: (Gay)

I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.
Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)

resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and
feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or
have married legally.
Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)
If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is
meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their
relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

My advocacy is to bring back love and joy to the streets- with focus on the homeless kids and senior citizens.Theres been a rubble of blood , hopelessness , darkness on our streets and with Manila street love,we try to introduce some light and love via our mobile outreach and campaigns.Why is it important to me? I drive around the streets almost every day and I don't really see much help is given.We forget they are people too and if we can make an impact at the moment why not? If we want to develop as a society ,we need to connect and move forward together .

One day, while other bees were busy collecting nectar from flowers to flowers, Chevy was assigned that day to protect the beehive. A group of hive beetles attacked the beehive where Chevy served as the soldier of the day. "Hey, you little bee! Get out of our way! Give us your sweet honey!" the leader of the hive beetle shouted. Chevy was so scared that he didn't even move a bit. Savy saw the whole scenario. He immediately flew towards the hive beetles and with all his might, he stung them. "Ouch!

"Can we talk for a minute, Savy?" asked Chevy. "Are you okay?" What is ite Tell me," replied Savy. "I'm sorry because all this time I have an ill feeling towards you," Chevy answered. "Huhe What did I do to hurt you" asked Savy. "Nothing, it is just that I envy you because everybody loves you," Chevy sadly replied. "That's alright. Don't worry, we can be friends!"

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

                                            In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

                            2. Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

But out of crisis comes an outpouring of response to provide support for mental and well-being of those who are vulnerable and people in the Frontline during and after the covid-19 outbreak. it is hard to fight a battle when you cannot see the enemy. this is what makes everything so hard in this crisis we face. the lawmakers are lost with what to do. it's a hit &amp; miss situation when it comes to implementing guidelines. but there are so many people affected with the loss of jobs. the inability to earn a living, dependence in government subsidy and resources, which is so finite and scarce. so the vulnerable population has grown even more vulnerable and now, even the middle class are affected. as a humanitarian responder, I know I have to do something and I know I can do more. quarantine is not a hindrance. What gives you hope. My faith in God keeps me going. I Know that I have a God greater than all og these elements put together. My love for him inspires and pushes me to do my work and do this for others. Believeng also in the strength of local communities and partners gives me hope.kwowing that they also willing to be part of the solution. Helping the duty bearers by sharing the feedback of the valnerable sector. The idea of being able to help means i am able to effect others too.

                            10.  The next week Mother become very ill.She was rushed to the hospital. I was allowed to see her only after a day Father said she was too weak to even speak. When l come in her hospital room i saw her hugging a doll . An awfully ugly little doll binked several times and raised its slimy little  hands to Mother. My Mother. What's THAT?lwrinkled my nose in disgust. Why honey, she's your little baby sister. You are a big brother now! And she hugged up again! Yuck My lips curled and i ran out out of the room. I wiped the tears that rolled down my cheeks. I was jealous. My father found me and scolded me. He said I should go and apologize to Mother for upsetting her After some spanking. I obeyed. I went book to her room "You're a liar. - you told me you love me. I do, sweetie.. Then, why? Aren't shouted at Mother. you happy you have a sister to play with a now "No." And that was that, Mother tried hard to establish ties between the ugly doll and me. But really don't ike it. 's no fun at all, not like Mother, I can't cimb trees, it can't run fast, it wets the bed it keeps on crying every time it trips and.it's always with Mother. It's stealing Mother away from me. Mother had two more ugly dolls the next year. She said they're "eye-dental things. Maybe because their eyes and teeth look the same. In fact, they looked like so much that I can't tell one ugly doll from another. I often saw Mother take different colored stones. Father said it should stop Mother from making more ugly dolls. But I didn't think that it worked because in the next seven years, nine screaming ugly dolls, some with long hair, others with short hair, surrounded me. Some are colored like chocolates, others milky, and still some are the color of coffee. There are thin ums and fat 'ums. but all of them are annoyingly noisy. And unbearably ugly, They even drool like my dog. Tagpi. I despised them all and I promised myself that when I grow up. i would develop a medicine to stop mothers from having ugly dolls. The witch doctors and faith healers in our town couldn't stop Mother from moking ugly dols. but I will. And now have grown up. In my quest to stop mothers from making ugly babies (my father threatened to stop me from schooling if i continue calling Mother's girls as ugly dolls. so now! call them ugly babies instead). I ended up in medical school. I become on obstetrician-gynecologist. I'm on my way to the delivery room for my first time to deliver an ugly baby. I still loathe babies. Ugly dolls that they are. Five hours later, I tapped the back of the newborn and a cry is heard. I stared at the helpless thing not realizing that tears are rolling down my cheeks again. This time, I smiled.

In answering the questions try to appreciate the situations using the social norms you remember. Situation Number 1: A Very good friend of yours visits you and your family in your house. Your mother who was delighted by her presence cooks her best dish for your friend. Your friend loved the whole lunch that she kept complementing your mother for being such a good cook. At the end of her visit, she expresses her gratitude to the whole family. Before she leaves, she approaches your mother and asks, "how much do I pay you for the lunch you cooked for me? (Ariely, 2010)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>My reaction/ or my mother’s reaction:
</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>“How much do I pay for the lunch you cooked for me?”
</p><p>Is more likely a light-hearted compliment and joke. Because you pay something in exchange of something really good. I believe the friend was superbly delighted by the cooking that she compared it to be similar  when eating in a restaurant. She supposes that the mother should be paid by her talent, time, and effort in cooking.  </p><p>Off course, visitors are treated as special and being hospitable, we just laugh off these kinds of comments.

                            14. Once upon a time, there lived a big mango tree. A little boy loved to come and play around it every day. He climbed to the tree top, ate the mangoes, took a nap under the shadow... He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him. Time went by, the little boy grew, and he no longer played around the tree. One day, the boy came back to the tree with a sad look on his face. "Come and play with me," the tree asked the boy. "I am no longer a kid, I don't play around trees anymore." The boy replied, "I want toys. I need money to buy them." "Sorry, I don't have money... but you can pick all my mangoes and sell them so you will have money." The boy was so excited. He picked all the mangoes on the tree and left happily. The boy didn't come back. The tree was sad. One day, the boy grown into a man returned. The tree was so excited. "Come and play with me," the tree said. "I don't have time to play. I have to work for my family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?" "Sorry, I don't have a house, but you can chop off my branches to build your house." So the man cut all the branches off the tree and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the boy didn't come back afterward. The tree was again lonely and sad. One hot summer day, the man returned and the tree was delighted. "Come and play with me!" The tree said. "I am sad and getting old. I want to go sailing to relax myself. Can you give me a boat?" "Use my trunk to build your boat. You can sail far away and be happy." So the man cut the tree trunk to make a boat. He went sailing and didn't come back for a long time. Finally, the man returned after he had been gone for so many years. "Sorry, my boy, but I don't have anything for you anymore. No more mangoes to give you." The tree said. "I don't have teeth to bite," the man replied. "No more trunk for you to climb on." "I am too old for that now," the man said. "I really can't give you anything, the only thing left is my dying roots," the tree said with sadness. "I don't need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all these years," the man replied. "Good! Old tree roots are the best place to lean on and rest. Come sit down with me and rest." The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled.

                            15. Read the excerpt below:
An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind
aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making
decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it
should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas
which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine
several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the SAME SEX MARRIAGE that
is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals.
Father Nael: (Priest)
It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a
sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the
commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.
Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)
It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children?
Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake.
Mr. Serge: (Gay)
I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And
I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.
Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)
It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot
resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and
feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or
have married legally.
Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)
If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is
meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their
relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

Air Castles
By Juan F. Salazar
My life’s tomorrow beckons me
From distant mountains high and low;
My future seems a boundless sea,
Where moving passions come and go.
Deep in my heart ambition dwells;
He cheers me up the highland,
And guides me through the hills and dells
Where I pass the busy day.
I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,
But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;
I love his skill his craft of men,
His mastery of poet’s art.
I do not care for fame, as he,
Enthroned was like unto a god:
The depths he reached are dark to me.
But I will grope the ways he tried.
I wear achievement’s coronet.
For best are they who see things done!
And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.
If I be met by adverse fate,
And all my dreams but in vain;
Then, must I work the harder yet
With high resolve to try again.

Where moving passions come and go.

And guides me through the hills and dells

And all my cares I soon forget
When I have wrought my work alone.

And all my dreams but in vain;

                            29. In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'
