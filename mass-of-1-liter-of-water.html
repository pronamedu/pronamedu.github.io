                                            DETERMINATION OF DENSITIES DISCUSSION :The density of an object is defined as its mass per unit volume. Mathematically it can be expressed as:  Formula : D= M/V Where : D= density , M= mass , V= volume This usually expressed as grams per millilter (g/ml ) for liquids , grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) for solid , and grams per Liter (g/L) for gases.I. OBJECTIVES :  After completing the activity , you should be able to:1. Learn the proper technique in measuring the mass and the volume ;2. Determine the densities of some solids and liquids , and3. Apply the rules of significant figures when reporting the weight, volume and density of each material.

                            24. DETERMINATION OF DENSITIES DISCUSSION :The density of an object is defined as its mass per unit volume. Mathematically it can be expressed as:  Formula : D= M/V Where : D= density , M= mass , V= volume This usually expressed as grams per millilter (g/ml ) for liquids , grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) for solid , and grams per Liter (g/L) for gases.I. OBJECTIVES :  After completing the activity , you should be able to:1. Learn the proper technique in measuring the mass and the volume ;2. Determine the densities of some solids and liquids , and3. Apply the rules of significant figures when reporting the weight, volume and density of each material. II- INSTRUCTION :1.0 DENSITY OF LIQUIDS:1.1 Density of water To determine the density of water , first is to get the mass of the water based from the given value below by obtaining the difference from the mass of empty cylinder and mass of the graduated and water . Assume that the volume of water is 40 ml . Compute its density .1.2 Density of colored liquid (KMnO4)To determine the density of KMnO4 , first is to get the mass of the liquid based from the given value below, by obtaining the difference from the mass of empty cylinder and mass of the graduated and KMnO4 . Assume that the volume of KMnO4 is 5 ml . Compute its density .2. 0 Density of Solids2.1 Density of regulary shaped solid  The mass of the wood is already given , determine the volume of the block of wood by following the formula below. Volume of the block of wood = LXWXH Compute its density .2.2 Density of the Irregularly shaped solid ( green jade sample ) To get the volume of the irregularly shaped solid, perform using the water displacement method. Compute the density by using the given value for the mass . II.
