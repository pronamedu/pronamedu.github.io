1. I am composed of the deeper part of crust, mantle, and core;
It’s where the earthquakes originate and make a score,
Seismic waves provide information and record,
That’s why I was investigated and discovered.
What am I? _________________
2. I am a type of seismic waves,
That travel thousand meters beneath the waves,
When my vibrations reach the earth surface,
It will give rise to a type called surface waves.
What am I? _________________
3. I am commonly called as the S waves,
Rock and solid matter -I can displace,
Moving objects up and down and sideways,
Traveling perpendicular to the direction of my waves.
What am I? __________________
4. A type of S waves that you want to be denied,
Because I shake and move the ground side to side
What am I? _________________
5. I am the vibrations that cause ground shaking,
And the reason why earthquakes are appearing,
My after-effect is infrastructures breaking,
and sometimes the death of many living things.
What am I? _________________
6. I am a type of S waves that make you frown,
Because I do shake the ground up and down
What am I? _________________
7. I am considered as vibrations under primary,
A body waves that cause trouble and make you worry,
In matter with solid, liquid, and even fluid property,
Where I can travel and cause damage severely.
What am I? _________________
8. I am the vibrations on the earth surface,
I have two types the Rayleigh and the Love waves,
I can only move along the earth’s outer layer,
Movement on landforms and ripples on bodies of water.

First, write the text type of the selection. Then, write a one to two-sentence explanation of your answer. Write your responses on your answer sheet. 1. Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</a>

How Theory Develops? As evidence from numerous investigations builds up, a particular hypothesis may become so well supported that scientists consider it a theory. That is what happened with the hypothesis that new organisms come from existing organisms. This idea is now considered one of the major ideas in science. In science, the word theory applies to a well- tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations. I Supported with observation​</a>

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</h2><br />

                            20. (Body waves, mantel, secondary waves, interior of the earth, primary waves, seismic waves, love waves, rayleigh waves, surface waves)
1. I am composed of the deeper part of crust, mantle, and core;
It’s where the earthquakes originate and make a score,
Seismic waves provide information and record,
That’s why I was investigated and discovered.
What am I? _________________
2. I am a type of seismic waves,
That travel thousand meters beneath the waves,
When my vibrations reach the earth surface,
It will give rise to a type called surface waves.
What am I? _________________
3. I am commonly called as the S waves,
Rock and solid matter -I can displace,
Moving objects up and down and sideways,
Traveling perpendicular to the direction of my waves.
What am I? __________________
4. A type of S waves that you want to be denied,
Because I shake and move the ground side to side
What am I? _________________
5. I am the vibrations that cause ground shaking,
And the reason why earthquakes are appearing,
My after-effect is infrastructures breaking,
and sometimes the death of many living things.
What am I? _________________
6. I am a type of S waves that make you frown,
Because I do shake the ground up and down
What am I? _________________
7. I am considered as vibrations under primary,
A body waves that cause trouble and make you worry,
In matter with solid, liquid, and even fluid property,
Where I can travel and cause damage severely.
What am I? _________________
8. I am the vibrations on the earth surface,
I have two types the Rayleigh and the Love waves,
I can only move along the earth’s outer layer,
Movement on landforms and ripples on bodies of water.
What am I? _________________
