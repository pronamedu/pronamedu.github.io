                                            Rizal’s Letter: To the Young Women of Malolos(excerpt)When I wrote Noli Me Tangere, I asked myself whether bravery was a common thing in the young women of our people. I brought back to my recollection and reviewed those I had known since my infancy, but there were only few who seem to come up to my ideal. There was, it is true, an abundance of girls with agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but there was in all an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so called “spiritual fathers” (as if the spirit or soul had any father other than God), due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. They seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap.However, when the news of what happened at Malolos reached us, I saw my error, and great was my rejoicing. After all, who is to blame me? I did not know Malolos nor its young women, except one called Emila [Emilia Tiongson, whom Rizal met in 1887], and her I knew by name only.Now that you have responded to our first appeal in the interest of the welfare of the people; now that you have set an example to those who, like you, long to have their eyes opened and be delivered from servitude, new hopes are awakened in us and we now even dare to face adversity, because we have you for our allies and are confident of victory. No longer does the Filipina stand with her head bowed nor does she spend her time on her knees, because she is quickened by hope in the future; no longer will the mother contribute to keeping her daughter in darkness and bring her up in contempt and moral annihilation. And no longer will the science of all sciences consist in blind submission to any unjust order, or in extreme complacency, nor will a courteous smile be deemed the only weapon against insult or humble tears the ineffable panacea for all tribulations. You know that the will of God is different from that of the priest; that religiousness does not consist of long periods spent on your knees, nor in endless prayers, big rosarios, and grimy scapularies [religious garment showing devotion], but in a spotless conduct, firm intention, and upright judgment. You also know that prudence does not consist in blindly obeying any whim of the little tin god, but in obeying only that which is reasonable and just, because blind obedience is itself the cause and origin of those whims, and those guilty of it are really to be blamed. The official or friar can no longer assert that they alone are responsible for their unjust orders, because God gave each individual reason and a will of his or her own to distinguish the just from the unjust; all were born without shackles and free, and nobody has a right to subjugate the will and the spirit of another your thoughts. And, why should you submit to another your thoughts, seeing that thought is noble and free?THIS SUBJECT IS "21ST CENTURY LITERATURE"Question:Base on the first paragraph, how did jose rizal describe the filipino wowen?​</a>

                                            (Analyze a Particular Point of View:)
Freedom
Freedom from fear is the freedom
I claim for you my motherland!
Freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,
breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning
call of the future;
Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith
you fasten yourself in night's stillness,
mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;
freedom from the anarchy of destiny
whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,
and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.
Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,
where movements are started through brainless wires,
repeated through mindless habits,
where figures wait with patience and obedience for the 
master of show,
to be stirred into a mimicry of life.

                                            APPLICATION *The Filipino of today is soft, easy going. His tendency is towards parasitism. He is uninclined to sustained strenous lacks earnestness. Face saving effort! He is the dominant note in the confused Symphony of his existance. His sense of righteouness is often dulled by the desire of personal gain. His norm of conduct is generally prompted by expendiency rather than by principle. He shows a falling in that superb courage which impels action because it is right, even at the cost of self-sacrifice. His greatest fear is not to do wrong, but of caught doing wrong. being to and be like I want our people grow the molave, strong and resilient, rising on the hillside. unafraid of the raging flood, or the storm. confident of the lightning sits own strength. N TREATED! If we have the will to survive and the will to achieve task of spiritual social efficiency, we cannot delay this regeneration. Let us begin to mold typical Filipino still We have attained our freedom, but our spirit is bound by the shackles forged from the frailties of our nature. We owe it to ourselves and our posterity to strike them down. We are Orientals. We are known for our placidity and passivity. In the world of humanity, we are looked upon as a quiet and smooth lake from which the adventurous and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow the Filipino to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent, full of life of hope, of faith, and of strength... &gt; other peoples of the world are straining themselves to attain higher levels of progress and national securiti We shall not lag behind. The filipino are on the march, towards their destiny, to conquer their place in the sun! APPLICATION1. What type of audience is addressed?2. What is the writer's intention? 3.

He finds himself in the Purgatory waiting room, when God enters…“Well, Bill,” says God, “I’m confused. I’m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell: you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in the world, and yet you’ve also created some of the most unearthly frustrations known to mankind. I’m going to do something I’ve never done before: I’m going to let you choose where you want to go.”Bill replies, “Well, thanks, God. What’s the difference between the two?”God says, “I’m willing to let you visit both places briefly to help you make your decision.”“Okay, where should I go first?” asks Bill.God says, “That’s up to you.”Bill says, “OK, let’s try Hell first.”So Bill goes to Hell. It’s a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters. There are thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun is shining, the temperature is just right. The whole thing looks perfect, and Bill is very pleased.“This is great!” he tells God, “If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!”“Fine,” says God, and off they go.Heaven is a high place in the clouds, with angels drifting about playing harps and singing. It very nice but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thinks for a moment and announces his decision.“Hmm, I think I prefer Hell.” he tells God.“Fine,” says God, “As you desire.”So Bill Gates is taken to Hell.Two weeks later, God decides to check up on Bill to see how he’s doing in Hell. When God arrives in Hell, he finds Bill shackled to a wall, screaming amongst the hot flames in a dark cave. He’s being burned and tortured by demons.“How’s everything going, Bill?” God asks.Bill replies, his voice full of anguish and disappointment, “This is awful, it’s not what I expected at all, I can’t believe it. What happened to that other place with the beaches and the beautiful women playing in the water?”God smiles and says, “That was the screen saver.”​</a>

                            7. Rizal’s Letter: To the Young Women of Malolos(excerpt)When I wrote Noli Me Tangere, I asked myself whether bravery was a common thing in the young women of our people. I brought back to my recollection and reviewed those I had known since my infancy, but there were only few who seem to come up to my ideal. There was, it is true, an abundance of girls with agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but there was in all an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so called “spiritual fathers” (as if the spirit or soul had any father other than God), due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. They seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap.However, when the news of what happened at Malolos reached us, I saw my error, and great was my rejoicing. After all, who is to blame me? I did not know Malolos nor its young women, except one called Emila [Emilia Tiongson, whom Rizal met in 1887], and her I knew by name only.Now that you have responded to our first appeal in the interest of the welfare of the people; now that you have set an example to those who, like you, long to have their eyes opened and be delivered from servitude, new hopes are awakened in us and we now even dare to face adversity, because we have you for our allies and are confident of victory. No longer does the Filipina stand with her head bowed nor does she spend her time on her knees, because she is quickened by hope in the future; no longer will the mother contribute to keeping her daughter in darkness and bring her up in contempt and moral annihilation. And no longer will the science of all sciences consist in blind submission to any unjust order, or in extreme complacency, nor will a courteous smile be deemed the only weapon against insult or humble tears the ineffable panacea for all tribulations. You know that the will of God is different from that of the priest; that religiousness does not consist of long periods spent on your knees, nor in endless prayers, big rosarios, and grimy scapularies [religious garment showing devotion], but in a spotless conduct, firm intention, and upright judgment. You also know that prudence does not consist in blindly obeying any whim of the little tin god, but in obeying only that which is reasonable and just, because blind obedience is itself the cause and origin of those whims, and those guilty of it are really to be blamed. The official or friar can no longer assert that they alone are responsible for their unjust orders, because God gave each individual reason and a will of his or her own to distinguish the just from the unjust; all were born without shackles and free, and nobody has a right to subjugate the will and the spirit of another your thoughts. And, why should you submit to another your thoughts, seeing that thought is noble and free?THIS SUBJECT IS "21ST CENTURY LITERATURE"Question:Base on the first paragraph, how did jose rizal describe the filipino wowen?​</h2><br />
                        <p>In the first paragraph of the letter "To the Young Women of Malolos," Jose Rizal described the young women of his time as having agreeable manners, beautiful ways, and modest demeanor, but with an admixture of servitude and deference to the words or whims of their so-called "spiritual fathers." He also remarked that they seemed faded plants sown and reared in darkness, having flowers without perfume and fruits without sap. Rizal observed that the young women of his time lacked bravery and seemed to be living in servitude, which was due to excessive kindness, modesty, or perhaps ignorance. He was looking for young women who would come up to his ideal, and at first, he thought there were only a few.</p><br />

                            12. (Analyze a Particular Point of View:)
Freedom
Freedom from fear is the freedom
I claim for you my motherland!
Freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,
breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning
call of the future;
Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith
you fasten yourself in night's stillness,
mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;
freedom from the anarchy of destiny
whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,
and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.
Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,
where movements are started through brainless wires,
repeated through mindless habits,
where figures wait with patience and obedience for the 
master of show,
to be stirred into a mimicry of life.

Face saving effort! He is the dominant note in the confused Symphony of his existance. His sense of righteouness is often dulled by the desire of personal gain. His norm of conduct is generally prompted by expendiency rather than by principle. He shows a falling in that superb courage which impels action because it is right, even at the cost of self-sacrifice. His greatest fear is not to do wrong, but of caught doing wrong. being to and be like I want our people grow the molave, strong and resilient, rising on the hillside. unafraid of the raging flood, or the storm. confident of the lightning sits own strength.

We owe it to ourselves and our posterity to strike them down. We are Orientals. We are known for our placidity and passivity. In the world of humanity, we are looked upon as a quiet and smooth lake from which the adventurous and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow the Filipino to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent, full of life of hope, of faith, and of strength... &gt; other peoples of the world are straining themselves to attain higher levels of progress and national securiti We shall not lag behind.

He finds himself in the Purgatory waiting room, when God enters…“Well, Bill,” says God, “I’m confused. I’m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell: you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in the world, and yet you’ve also created some of the most unearthly frustrations known to mankind. I’m going to do something I’ve never done before: I’m going to let you choose where you want to go.”Bill replies, “Well, thanks, God. What’s the difference between the two?”God says, “I’m willing to let you visit both places briefly to help you make your decision.”“Okay, where should I go first?” asks Bill.God says, “That’s up to you.”Bill says, “OK, let’s try Hell first.”So Bill goes to Hell. It’s a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters. There are thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about. The sun is shining, the temperature is just right. The whole thing looks perfect, and Bill is very pleased.“This is great!” he tells God, “If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!”“Fine,” says God, and off they go.Heaven is a high place in the clouds, with angels drifting about playing harps and singing. It very nice but not as enticing as Hell. Bill thinks for a moment and announces his decision.“Hmm, I think I prefer Hell.” he tells God.“Fine,” says God, “As you desire.”So Bill Gates is taken to Hell.Two weeks later, God decides to check up on Bill to see how he’s doing in Hell. When God arrives in Hell, he finds Bill shackled to a wall, screaming amongst the hot flames in a dark cave. He’s being burned and tortured by demons.“How’s everything going, Bill?” God asks.Bill replies, his voice full of anguish and disappointment, “This is awful, it’s not what I expected at all, I can’t believe it.
