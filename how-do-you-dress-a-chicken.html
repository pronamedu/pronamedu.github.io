                                            "But your father has long been dead," I commented. "The farm is yours and you can do what you want to increase its yield. Other coconut trees yield 320 coconuts per tree per year, you make 80 coconuts per tree and you are perfectly happy, Yet from your chicken layers you want literally two eggs a day, and from your rice farm, you want no less than 250 cavans per hectare." "Magagalit si Tatay pag ginalaw ko ang mga puno (Father will get angry if I touch the trees)," he said simply. He said it with evident sadness. I began to feel sorry for having delved into such personal and emotional matters. "But you will like the story," Pare Tonying said with a smile. This was his way of showing he took no offense. I allowed him to remain silent for a while longer. The urge to ask a litany of questions was very strong but I controlled it. Let him begin by himself, I resolved. Soon, Pare Tonying started the story. "You know, long ago, on several occasions I wanted to cut down and remove all the coconut trees. But each time, I got a dressing down from my father. I told him about the new dwarf coconut that gave fruits after five to seven years. They were so low, one did not have to worry about typhoons ashing their tops. No need for coconut pickers, as the trees were short and the fruits low. And the economic returns were enormous. Imagine four times more yield! But Tatay (Father) would not listen. His explanation will interest you. Tatay said he planted these coconut trees when I was born. He made a habit of planting a hundred trees for every child he had. Every year, the yield fulfilled our needs. My brothers and sisters finished school from the coconut yield. According to Tatay, coconut trees yield more when one's needs are more. So at that time, the yield was plentiful. Now that all of us are grown up, the coconut trees no longer bear as much fruit because we are not in need. And he said that to cut down trees after they had sustained us all these years is the height of ingratitude. When Tatay died, the farm was given to me because I was the only one who did not finish college. And from the meager coconut yield, I was able to start (magpundar) my present poultry and rice business. Now, how can I cut down and replace these?" Pare Tonying looked at me. "Don't you cut down those coconut trees!" I said with conviction. Maybe I was thinking of my own father-not of the coconut trees.​</a>

                            4. "But your father has long been dead," I commented. "The farm is yours and you can do what you want to increase its yield. Other coconut trees yield 320 coconuts per tree per year, you make 80 coconuts per tree and you are perfectly happy, Yet from your chicken layers you want literally two eggs a day, and from your rice farm, you want no less than 250 cavans per hectare." "Magagalit si Tatay pag ginalaw ko ang mga puno (Father will get angry if I touch the trees)," he said simply. He said it with evident sadness. I began to feel sorry for having delved into such personal and emotional matters. "But you will like the story," Pare Tonying said with a smile. This was his way of showing he took no offense. I allowed him to remain silent for a while longer. The urge to ask a litany of questions was very strong but I controlled it. Let him begin by himself, I resolved. Soon, Pare Tonying started the story. "You know, long ago, on several occasions I wanted to cut down and remove all the coconut trees. But each time, I got a dressing down from my father. I told him about the new dwarf coconut that gave fruits after five to seven years. They were so low, one did not have to worry about typhoons ashing their tops. No need for coconut pickers, as the trees were short and the fruits low. And the economic returns were enormous. Imagine four times more yield! But Tatay (Father) would not listen. His explanation will interest you. Tatay said he planted these coconut trees when I was born. He made a habit of planting a hundred trees for every child he had. Every year, the yield fulfilled our needs. My brothers and sisters finished school from the coconut yield. According to Tatay, coconut trees yield more when one's needs are more. So at that time, the yield was plentiful. Now that all of us are grown up, the coconut trees no longer bear as much fruit because we are not in need. And he said that to cut down trees after they had sustained us all these years is the height of ingratitude. When Tatay died, the farm was given to me because I was the only one who did not finish college. And from the meager coconut yield, I was able to start (magpundar) my present poultry and rice business. Now, how can I cut down and replace these?" Pare Tonying looked at me. "Don't you cut down those coconut trees!" I said with conviction. Maybe I was thinking of my own father-not of the coconut trees.​</h2><br />
