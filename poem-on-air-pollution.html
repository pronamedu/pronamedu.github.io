Warned
By Silvia Stuits
The sands of time have rendered fear
Blue skies on high no longer clear
Stars were bright whence they came
Now dimmed, obscured, pollution's haze
One can't blame pollution alone
As they say you reap what you've sown
So let us plant a better seed
Tear out old roots, cultivate, weed
Crystal clear our waters gleamed
Fish abundant, rivers streamed
Ocean floors sandy white
Now littered, brown, pollution's plight
Protect what has been given for free
Our waters, skies, wildlife and trees
For once they're gone, don't you say
Consider yourself warned of that fatal day
Trees towered high above

1. There are many reasons why our class goes to the library once a week for what
we call “Book Hour.” For one, our teacher has observed that many of us read
poorly when asked to read aloud a story or poem in class. Another reason is
that most of us at home have an Internet provider. As a result, our teacher has
noticed that the home research we submit are lifted from online references.
When our teacher checked our borrowings from the library, most of us have
not brought home a storybook or reference related to the different subjects.
Thus, for many weeks now, we get to hold books and do our readings for an
hour in the library.
2. If you are looking for fun this summer, what better place to go but to our newly

3. Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are
caused by exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural
events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air,
especially in highly urbanized towns, cities, mainly because the government
lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise,
the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories
that emit gas elsewhere. Most often than not, air pollution is caused by natural
events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion and pollen
dispersal.
4. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading,
you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don’t feel
like interacting with your new friends you just stop reading. Going on vacation
gives you the opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and see new places
with your eyes but you have to spend much more for your fare, your food, and
the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends
become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily.
5. The water shortage that hit the country lately causes several problems.
Because of water shortage, public places like local restaurants and many other
places are forced to use very little water for cleaning which causes huge
sanitation issues. In household settings, clean drinking water is also hard to
acquire. Lack of water also results in clogged sewage, a perfect breeding place
for mosquitoes and other insects---the sources of dengue, malaria, and other
diseases. In rural areas, growing of plants becomes a hard job because of less
irrigation, which leads to a shortage in crops like rice.</a>

                            4. Care for the mother earthMother earth has lots of giftto us she brings and afterssee the clean rivers and the sea'ssee the clear falls and the springs see the tall mountains and forestsee the green hills all around.but look once more and seelook at the dirty sea's and river'slook at the bareforests and mountainslook at the polluted  air we breathlook once more and see mother earth has a lots of giftnow question1. Compare the gifts of mother earth at the start and at the end of the poem2. What do you think is the cause why the gifts of mother earth looks like now3. if mother earth can talk what do you think is she saying to us4. what are  you willing to do to save mother earth. anwers may also translated in english.... . .. </h2><br />
                        1. The first half of the poem talks about how Mother Earth gave us so many gifts that we can benefit only if we take care of them. Rivers, streams, mountains,--- all of them are gifts from Mother Earth. They bring wonder and bring peacefulness in one's mind and body. Giving us fresh air to breathe, clear water to drink, clean waters for sanitation, in other words, these bring forth good blessings to us, people. While at the other half of the poem, it talks about how the gifts of Mother Earth were destroyed and were annihilated by no other than, us, the suppose-to-be caretakers of it. We were supposed to take care of it yet we were the ones, the first ones, to destroy it, making our lives now hard. It's effect is highly making us affected by it such as easily being flooded, landslides, flash floods, and other disasters that made Mother Earth angry at us.<br /><br />2. The gifts of Mother Earth looks like what we are seeing right now, mainly because we started to ignore it's importance in our daily lives. We tend to ignore it's presence, and not caring for it like some cut trees illegally even if some trees are still sturdy and young that would eventually help us in the future when floods/ or other calamities might strike us. Burning trees to make the land plain, in order to make villages is one thing that is rampantly happening to the modern day world of today too.<br /><br />3.If Mother Earth would talk, I would really predict that she's saying and reminding us, caretakers, to take care and watch over her gifts. She wants us to stop causing too much pollution, and other bad things that will later result to horrible ones. She wants us to change for the better, not only is she telling us to do these for her sake, but this is also for the good of us, people because actually, in reality, we are the ones mostly benefitting of these gifts. <br /><br />4. I, as a caretaker, and human, am willing to do what I can for the sake of the world's peace and order, for our sake, and for Mother Earth too. By using reforestation method. Cutting old trees then replacing them with new ones. As young as I am right now, I can't do big acts such as ceasing dynamite fishing, kaingin system, and even make a law about "No Pollution Day", yet by even little acts, it can make a very big difference to our world. Recycling paper, throwing garbages into the right places, saving water and electricity are things that a kid like you can do too. Even if it's a small thing, it can really change a lot in the future.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p>What is air pollution?
</p><p>book defines as contamination of gases;
</p><p>But is the definition this much only,
</p><p>or you think there's some more, yes there is!
</p><p>
</p><p> It is caused when the air balance,
</p><p>of our atmosphere gets altered;
</p><p>Mainly because it causes CO2 to increase,
</p><p>and makes O2 blurred.
</p><p>
</p><p>How is it caused?
</p><p>by burning fuel, exhaust gas and pollutants in air;
</p><p>Smokes, greenhouse gases,
</p><p>and a bit of human error present there.
</p><p>
</p><p>These were some man-made ones,
</p><p>but we also have some natural reasons;
</p><p>2 of these are the following,
</p><p>forest fires and volcanic eruptions.
</p><p>
</p><p>Air pollution has very bad effects,
</p><p>like acid rains and global warming;
</p><p>These are attacking our Earth,
</p><p>and to us they are harming.
</p><p>
</p><p>Air pollution can be controlled,
</p><p>by washing factory smoke by jets of water;
</p><p>By using CNG and less smoked fuels,
</p><p>and spreading awareness between father, mother, son and daughter.
</p><p>
</p><p>It's now completely our choice,
</p><p>we need to choose the life we want;
</p><p>Having trees and fresh air,
</p><p>or letting pollution make our lives a haunt.</p><p></p><p>#KEEPLEARNING</p><br />

Environmental destruction, since it emphasizes the types of pollutions in the environment.</p><p>2.. The lines depict air pollution, with the stars and the blue skies not seen clearly as the biggest hint.</p><p>3.. The lines depict water pollution, since it is obviously stated in the first line, and with the ocean floors getting contaminated.</p><p>4. Deforestation is depicted in the third stanza, since it is mentioned that "paper joined pollution's team", and papers are made from trees that have been cut down; hence, deforestation.</p><p>5. The answer is the explanation.</p><p>6. The lines are metaphorical. The first line instructs us to do a better job at preserving the environment and that is through building eco-friendly organizations, realizing programs that serve the protection of the environment, and planting a seed that is an idea or, better yet, a practice that would further the betterment and integration of the environment. The second line instructs us to abolish old activities that are the root cause of environmental destruction in the first place.</p><p>7. Letter a is a general answer, while letter D is specific. Nonetheless, both answers convey the same meaning, which is to protect and take care of our environment.</p><p>8. I am not certain with this answer; however, I am certain that it could fit the poem, since it depicts pollution and how it remains to be perpetuated by us humans. We do not and cannot progress to a society with better environment, because we have not changed at all. Should we change our actions and take initiative of changing the environment (i.e. through cleaning the dirty waters, stop littering, ceasing factory dumps, etc.), progress is possible. But those who remain insensitive to the environment's needs remain as stagnant as frozen meat.</p><br />

Warned
By Silvia Stuits
The sands of time have rendered fear
Blue skies on high no longer clear
Stars were bright whence they came
Now dimmed, obscured, pollution's haze
One can't blame pollution alone
As they say you reap what you've sown
So let us plant a better seed
Tear out old roots, cultivate, weed
Crystal clear our waters gleamed
Fish abundant, rivers streamed
Ocean floors sandy white
Now littered, brown, pollution's plight
Protect what has been given for free
Our waters, skies, wildlife and trees
For once they're gone, don't you say
Consider yourself warned of that fatal day
Trees towered high above

                            23. PRACTICE EXERCISE 1
DIRECTIONS: Read the short texts below and distinguish the text type that shows
cause-effect. On the space provided before the number, put a ( / ) if the text is a
cause-effect text and ( × ) if it does not.
1. There are many reasons why our class goes to the library once a week for what
we call “Book Hour.” For one, our teacher has observed that many of us read
poorly when asked to read aloud a story or poem in class. Another reason is
that most of us at home have an Internet provider. As a result, our teacher has
noticed that the home research we submit are lifted from online references.
When our teacher checked our borrowings from the library, most of us have
not brought home a storybook or reference related to the different subjects.
Thus, for many weeks now, we get to hold books and do our readings for an
hour in the library.
2. If you are looking for fun this summer, what better place to go but to our newly
renovated Splash Kingdom! It has everything you want---swimming pool for
kids and adults, different amusement rides, games, billiards, videoke, other
forms of entertainment, and wonderful facilities for you to enjoy. For sports
lovers, we have bowling, table tennis, and darts shooting in our arcade. We also
offer swimming lessons for children ages 5-7 at a very affordable fee. Our
instructors are swimming coaches from the best schools. What are you waiting
for? Come and visit us now! For more information, call us at 1267-489.
3. Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are
caused by exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural
events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air,
especially in highly urbanized towns, cities, mainly because the government
lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise,
the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories
that emit gas elsewhere. Most often than not, air pollution is caused by natural
events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion and pollen
dispersal.
4. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading,
you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don’t feel
like interacting with your new friends you just stop reading. Going on vacation
gives you the opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and see new places
with your eyes but you have to spend much more for your fare, your food, and
the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends
become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily.
5. The water shortage that hit the country lately causes several problems.
Because of water shortage, public places like local restaurants and many other
places are forced to use very little water for cleaning which causes huge
sanitation issues. In household settings, clean drinking water is also hard to
acquire. Lack of water also results in clogged sewage, a perfect breeding place
for mosquitoes and other insects---the sources of dengue, malaria, and other
diseases. In rural areas, growing of plants becomes a hard job because of less
irrigation, which leads to a shortage in crops like rice.</h2><br />
