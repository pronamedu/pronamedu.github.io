                        UNIT CONVERSION: REAL LIFE APPLICATIONS<p><strong>Answers with Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Elisse has 20 meters of ribbon. How many 15 cm of ribbon can be cut from it?</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>To determine how many 15 cm ribbon can be cut from a ribbon with length of 20 meters, we need to convert first meters into centimeters so that the two have the same units. The conversion factor is <strong>1 meters = 100 centimeters.</strong></p><p>20 meters × [tex]\frac{100 cm}{1m}[/tex] = 2,000 centimeters</p><p>Since we already solved 20 meters in centimeters, we can finally divide 2,000 by 15. Using the expression 2,000 ÷ 15. The answer is 133.33. We need to disregard the decimal places since what we are looking for is the 15-cm ribbons.</p><p><strong>Therefore, Elisse can cut 133 pieces of 15-cm ribbon from a 20-m long ribbon.</strong></p><p>2. Mr. JB has a rectangular lot that measures 550 meters by 0.75 km. What is the area of the land in square meters? He is selling the whole lot for 206,250,000 pesos, how much is the price per square meter? </p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>In order to solve for the area of the rectangular lot, recall the formula for solving the area of a rectangle which is A=LW where A is the area, L is the length and W is the width. But before we proceed to it, we need to convert first 0.75 kilometers to meters. Using the conversion factor: <strong>1 km = 1,000 m.</strong></p><p>0.75 km × [tex]\frac{1,000 m}{1km}[/tex] = 750 meters</p><p>By direct substitution:</p><p>A = LW</p><p>A = (750)(550) = <strong>412,500 sq. meters</strong></p><p><strong>Therefore, the area of the rectangular lot is 412,500 square meters.</strong></p><p>Now let us solve for how much each square meter costs, given that Mr. JB is selling the whole lot for 206,250,000 pesos. By division:</p><p>206,250,000 ÷ 412,500 = 500</p><p><strong>Therefore, Mr. JB's rectangular lot costs 500 pesos per square meter.</strong></p><p>3. Drinking 8 glasses of water a day is good for your health. If each glass of water is equivalent to 148 mL, how many liters of water you need to consume everyday?</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>So the conversion factor is <strong>1 glass = 148 mL.</strong></p><p>8 glass × [tex]\frac{148mL}{1glass}[/tex] = 1,184 mL</p><p>But the required unit is in liters, so we need to convert 1,184 milliliters to liters. Since: <strong>1 L = 1,000 mL</strong>, so:</p><p>1,184 mL × [tex]\frac{1L}{1,000mL}[/tex] = 1.184 L</p><p><strong>Therefore, we need to consume 1.184 L of water everyday.</strong></p><p>4. Your baby brother has a body temperature of 100 °F. What is his body temperature in °C? Does he has a normal body temperature? </p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>When we need to convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, the formula is:</p><p><strong>°C = (°F - 32) x 5/9</strong></p><p>By direct substitution:</p><p><strong>°C = (100 - 32) x 5/9</strong></p><p><strong>°C = 68 x 5/9 = </strong><strong>37.78 degrees Fahrenheit</strong></p><p>(Writer's Note: I changed 1,000 °F to 100 °F because it is unrealistic for a person to have a 1,000 °F body temperature. Maybe it was just a typographical error.)</p><p>The normal body temperature is 37 °C<strong> </strong>but it also ranges from 36 to 37.5 degrees Celsius, depending on the person. Since the baby brother has a body temperature of 37.78 degrees Celsius, then he does not have the normal body temperature and he has a fever.</p><p>5. Your mother asked you to buy 2.5 kg of sugar. Each pack of sugar in the store weighs 250 grams. How many packs of sugar will you buy?</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The conversion factor is <strong>1 kg = 1,000 grams.</strong></p><p>2.5 kg × [tex]\frac{1,000g}{1kg}[/tex] = 2,500 grams</p><p>Let us divide 2,500 by 250 = 10 packs.</p><p><strong>Therefore, I need to buy 10 pieces of 250-gram pack of sugar to have 2.5 kg sugar.</strong></p><p>6. The 120 grams powdered milk make 12 cups of milk. How many kilograms of powdered milk can produce 60 cups of milk. How many liters is 60 cups of milk?​</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The conversion factor is<strong> </strong><strong>120 grams = 12 cups.</strong></p><p>60 cups × [tex]\frac{120 grams}{12cups}[/tex] = [tex]\frac{7,200grams}{12}[/tex]= 600 grams</p><p>600 grams × [tex]\frac{1kg}{1,000g}[/tex] = 0.6 kg</p><p><strong>Therefore, 0.6 kilograms of powdered milk can produce 60 cups of milk.</strong></p><p>The conversion factor of cups to liters is: <strong>4 cups = 1 L</strong>, so:</p><p>60 cups × [tex]\frac{1L}{4cups}[/tex] = 15 L</p><p><strong>Therefore, 60 cups of milk is equal to 15 L.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Learn more about unit conversion:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3760928</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><br />
