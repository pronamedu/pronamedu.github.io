Original Context
The two types of surrogacy currently known to date are traditional and gestational surrogacy. For the traditional
method, the surrogate mother is artificially inseminated either by an intended father or an anonymous sperm donor, as
the surrogate mother will have planned to bear her own child. Hence, the child is related to both the surrogate mother,
and the intended father or the anonymous sperm donor. People who usually do this would want to raise a child without
sexual intimacy from the opposite sex. In the gestational method however, an egg is removed from the hopeful mother,
to be fertilized by the sperm of the intended father. The fertilized egg is then implanted into the uterus of the surrogate
mother, who will carry the child to term. In contrast with the traditional method, the child is not related to the surrogate
mother but only to the intended father or the anonymous sperm donor and the mother who possessed the egg.

For many months, he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom,and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that it was all he wanted.As graduation day was approaching, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morningof his graduation, his father called him into his private study room. His father told him how much he loved him. He handed his sona beautiful wrapped gift box Curious but somehow disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather-boundBible. Angrily, he raised his voice at his father and said,"With all your money, you give me a Bible?" and stormed out of the house, leaving the holy book.Many years passed and the young man was very successful in his business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family.He realized his father was very old and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Beforehe could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away and willed all of his possessions to hisson. He needed to come home immediately and took care of things.When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search his father's importantpapers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it few years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn pages. Ashe read those words, a car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealerwho had the sports car he had desired.

                                            "The Duplicate War: A Review" by David Lowe
Critique by Robert Keating
(1) The most valuable portion of any critique is "What I didn't like and why." (2) Unfortunately, there's not much
wrong with The Duplicate War: A Review. (3)I will try to be as specific as possible with my praise, so you'll know
what you did right.
(4) The vehicle of an opera review to tell your tale is an excellent one. (5)1 have seen this approach before, and it is
very effective as long as it keeps moving. (6) Your tale moved at a brisk (but not rushed) pace.
(7) "The photograph of his father in the wheelchair that had brought him back from Vietnam could be dusted..." (8)
The paragraph this line appears in is an excellent example of characterization by setting, and the line I referenced
is the wonderful little which completes the scene and sheds a little light on who Scott is.
(9) "The networks showed the tape over and over, he sat up drinking strong coffee and watched Michael every
hour until dawn." (10)I think that amending this line to end"... and watched Michael die every hour until dawn" will
add impact and help justify Scott's actions later.
(11) This is an excellent story and should see publication. (12) It is on par with what I see in the short science
fiction markets.

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</a>

Origins of the English Language
1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.
2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).
3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.
4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.
5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

Original Context
The two types of surrogacy currently known to date are traditional and gestational surrogacy. For the traditional
method, the surrogate mother is artificially inseminated either by an intended father or an anonymous sperm donor, as
the surrogate mother will have planned to bear her own child. Hence, the child is related to both the surrogate mother,
and the intended father or the anonymous sperm donor. People who usually do this would want to raise a child without
sexual intimacy from the opposite sex. In the gestational method however, an egg is removed from the hopeful mother,
to be fertilized by the sperm of the intended father. The fertilized egg is then implanted into the uterus of the surrogate
mother, who will carry the child to term. In contrast with the traditional method, the child is not related to the surrogate
mother but only to the intended father or the anonymous sperm donor and the mother who possessed the egg.

                        <strong>Topic for Essay Debate</strong><p>In a debate, information provided a subject from two opposed perspectives in a structured discussion or competition of ideas.</p><p></p><p><strong>1. Women: domestic or professional</strong></p>In every nation, women are traditionally the ones who take care of the young and elderly. Today, however, <strong>women are in charge of providing for the family's necessities and wants</strong>. I must admit that gender affects opportunities at work. What men can do, so can women. I firmly uphold professionalism. As you may have noticed, most women today are able to find high-quality employment. In banks, colleges, private and public corporations, and governmental organizations, there are many professional women.<p></p><p><strong>2. Women, should you decide on your pregnancy?</strong></p><strong>The pregnancy should be decided by both couples</strong>. since it requires both genders to produce offspring. This is a topic related to family planning while discussing pregnancy. Both parties should agree on childbirth. Since consulting a professional like a doctor is a factor, we cannot declare that women should make all decisions. Both of them should get guidance from an obstetrician who specializes in women's issues.<p></p><p><strong>3. Can a woman flirt?</strong></p><strong>Never can a woman flirt. </strong>The type of lady who flirts with men is not the typical female. I disagree because a man should be the one to tell a woman how much he loves her. A man traditionally performs harana on the woman he loved. They put a lot of effort into attracting women. Our society's modernism is not the issue. We must not think about a lady making out with a male.<p></p><p><strong>4. Who is the law in the home, Father or Mother?</strong></p><strong>At home, the mother and father have specific regulations. </strong>Parents came to this decision together. Even if the mother or father provides for the family's needs, it is still the parents' prerogative to enforce the law. Both should take part in decision making.<p></p><p><strong>5. Retokada: okay or not?</strong></p><strong>Being retokada is allowed. </strong>Stereotyping is a problem in today's culture. I've discovered that being attractive is a must for becoming popular. Investing in improving your look might give you more energy and confidence. We do it to demonstrate to the outside world that we are capable of more and that we can live fully.<p></p><p></p><p>Debate on globalization:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/4562759 </p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer’s showroom, and knowing that his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
</p><p>
</p><p>As Graduation Day approached the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car for him. Finally on the day he was to graduate his father called him into his private study, told him how proud he was to have such a fine son and how much he loved him. He then handed him a beautifully wrapped gift box.
</p><p>
</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            11. "The Duplicate War: A Review" by David Lowe
Critique by Robert Keating
(1) The most valuable portion of any critique is "What I didn't like and why." (2) Unfortunately, there's not much
wrong with The Duplicate War: A Review. (3)I will try to be as specific as possible with my praise, so you'll know
what you did right.
(4) The vehicle of an opera review to tell your tale is an excellent one. (5)1 have seen this approach before, and it is
very effective as long as it keeps moving. (6) Your tale moved at a brisk (but not rushed) pace.
(7) "The photograph of his father in the wheelchair that had brought him back from Vietnam could be dusted..." (8)
The paragraph this line appears in is an excellent example of characterization by setting, and the line I referenced
is the wonderful little which completes the scene and sheds a little light on who Scott is.
(9) "The networks showed the tape over and over, he sat up drinking strong coffee and watched Michael every
hour until dawn." (10)I think that amending this line to end"... and watched Michael die every hour until dawn" will
add impact and help justify Scott's actions later.
(11) This is an excellent story and should see publication. (12) It is on par with what I see in the short science
fiction markets.

"The Story Cinderella"1.consider the values conveyed in the portrayal of the good girl as passive weak submissive, but physically beautiful; and powerful woman as wicked and probably ugly cinderella?2.Consider the protentially misogynist theme of abused-girl-waiting-to-be-rescued-by-prince?"The Story Cinderella"THESISCinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.IN THE BEGINNINGCCinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</h2><br />

Origins of the English Language
1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.
2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).
3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English   spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.
4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.
5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.

"The Story Cinderella"1.consider the values conveyed in the portrayal of the good girl as passive weak submissive, but physically beautiful; and powerful woman as wicked and probably ugly cinderella?2.Consider the protentially misogynist theme of abused-girl-waiting-to-be-rescued-by-prince?"The Story Cinderella"THESISCinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.IN THE BEGINNINGCCinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</h2><br />
