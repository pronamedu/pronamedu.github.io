                                            GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too. 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer 3. which paragraph is the introduction 4. which part is the body of the essay 5. what does each paragraph contain 6. which paragraph is the conclusion 7. which does the conclusion ​</a>

                                            Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</a>

Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.​</a>

                                            1.The death penalty does not deter crime. Since it is inequitable administered, capital punishment is unjust. Because it does not deter crime, because it is inequitably administered, and because it is unjust, the death penalty should be abandoned by civilized societies.2. Marijuana is less harmful to health than smoking is. The prejudices about social conditions that led to current marijuana legislation are outdated. Because the social conditions that give rise to current marijuana legislation no longer exist and because of the potential medical and financial benefits of its decriminalization, lawmakers should reconsider the legal status of cannabis3. Public School Performance in the United States has plummated over the past 20 years. It is unfair to force taxpayers to contribute to a school system that does not serve them. Following the Canadian System, Congress should form a system for public funding of religious schools for families opt out of the public school system.4. Violence on television influences children to behave violently. Although the financial benefit for networks is great, it is ultimately counterproductive to air violent television shows. Because violence on television is harmful to all strata of American society, strict guidelines for permissible content of television shows should be enacted5. Publicly funded art is the most expensive art in the world. Taxpayer funding for public art produces a low yield both physically and spiritually.

                            9. GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too. 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer 3. which paragraph is the introduction 4. which part is the body of the essay 5. what does each paragraph contain 6. which paragraph is the conclusion 7. which does the conclusion ​</h2><br />

                            20. Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</h2><br />

                            25. 1.The death penalty does not deter crime. Since it is inequitable administered, capital punishment is unjust. Because it does not deter crime, because it is inequitably administered, and because it is unjust, the death penalty should be abandoned by civilized societies.2. Marijuana is less harmful to health than smoking is. The prejudices about social conditions that led to current marijuana legislation are outdated. Because the social conditions that give rise to current marijuana legislation no longer exist and because of the potential medical and financial benefits of its decriminalization, lawmakers should reconsider the legal status of cannabis3. Public School Performance in the United States has plummated over the past 20 years. It is unfair to force taxpayers to contribute to a school system that does not serve them. Following the Canadian System, Congress should form a system for public funding of religious schools for families opt out of the public school system.4. Violence on television influences children to behave violently. Although the financial benefit for networks is great, it is ultimately counterproductive to air violent television shows. Because violence on television is harmful to all strata of American society, strict guidelines for permissible content of television shows should be enacted5. Publicly funded art is the most expensive art in the world. Taxpayer funding for public art produces a low yield both physically and spiritually.

                            28. GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.Question: 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer?3. which paragraph is the introduction?4. which part is the body of the essay?5. what does each paragraph contain? 6. which paragraph is the conclusion?7. which does the conclusion?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The author's reason for writing is to argue against the practice of grading students and to suggest that it is a flawed system that does not contribute to education.Phrases that prove this answer include "is it right to categorize students," "grading encourages learning and without it students would not study," "the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades," and "grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts."The introduction is not clearly marked, but the first paragraph can be considered the introduction as it introduces the topic of grading and its relationship to education.The body of the essay includes paragraphs 2-5, which provide arguments against the practice of grading students and the flaws of the grading system.Paragraph 1 introduces the topic, paragraph 2 argues that grading is based on fear and encourages cheating, paragraph 3 argues that grading focuses on memorization rather than true learning, paragraph 4 argues that grading creates inequalities and conflicts, and paragraph 5 suggests that the grading system cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul of the educational system.The conclusion is not clearly marked, but the last sentence of paragraph 5 can be considered the conclusion: "To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished."The conclusion summarizes the author's main arguments and suggests that education should not be based on conflict and competition. It also provides a clear thesis statement that grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Mark me Brainliest&lt;3<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revolutionized global healthcare in an unprecedented way and with unimaginable repercussions. Resource reallocation, socioeconomic confinement and reorganization of production activities are current challenges being faced both at the national and international levels, in a frame of uncertainty and fear. Hospitals have been restructured to provide the best care to COVID-19 patients while adopting preventive strategies not to spread the infection among healthcare providers and patients affected by other diseases. As a consequence, the concept of urgency and indications for elective treatments have been profoundly reshaped. In addition, several providers have been recruited in COVID-19 departments despite their original occupation, resulting in a profound rearrangement of both inpatient and outpatient care. Orthopaedic daily practice has been significantly affected by the pandemic. Surgical indications have been reformulated, with elective cases being promptly postponed and urgent interventions requiring exceptional attention, especially in suspected or COVID-19+ patients. This has made a strong impact on inpatient management, with the need of a dedicated staff, patient isolation and restrictive visiting hour policies. On the other hand, outpatient visits have been limited to reduce contacts between patients and the hospital personnel, with considerable consequences on post-operative quality of care and the human side of medical practice.</p><p></p><p>In this review, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the orthopaedic practice. Particular attention will be dedicated to opportune surgical indication, perioperative care and safe management of both inpatients and outpatients, also considering repercussions of the pandemic on resident education and ethical implications.</p><br />
