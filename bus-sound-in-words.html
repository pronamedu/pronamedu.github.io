There are four types of transportation available in the metro. A tricycle is a motorcycle with an attached side car. It is used to transport people within villages or to nearby locations. Next, a jeepney is a homegrown transportation that can fit 16 to 22 people at a time. Its body components are usually made of stainless steel with fanciful decors. Inside, passengers will have to sit in a long cushioned bench on each side of the cab. A rather common type is the bus. Buses can fit in a maximum of 60 people at a time, and may follow a city or provincial route. Lastly is the train. Currently. there are four active train lines in Manila: the L RTA lines 1 and 2, the MRT3, and the PNR. Each train line has a specific route and it is the fastest way to get around the city.___2.If I have a choice, I would rather live by the sea than on a mountain. It's nice to wake up to the sound of the lapping waves and the smell of the fresh sea breeze. Unlike in the mountain where there's nothing much to see but trees, trees, and only trees. By the shore, you can do many things. You may dip your feet onto the cold sea water, play with sand, go boating, observe shells the choices are endless! I doubt if you can do as many things on a mountain. I can't think of any activity that I can do if ever I would live on a mountain, that's why I would rather live by the sea.1___3. Camiguin is an island off the coast of Mindanao. It is an island that formed out of one or several volcanic eruptions, thus it's called the island born of fire Despite it being the second smallest province in - the Philippines, it has so many things to offer. It has a beautiful sandbar, called White Island, which is not exactly an island but a landmass made of powdery white sand. The place is ideal for swimming as it is surrounded by clear water and two volcanoes. Another sight to behold in Camiguin is its rich coral and sea life, which may be seen when you go snorkeling in Mantigue Island. It is an islet that also has powdery white sand and blue crystal clear water. Camiguin Island itself boasts of other water forms such as falls, hot, and cold springs. Katibawasan Falls is a 250-feet high falls that cascades onto a rock pool surrounded by orchids, ferns, and boulders. Its cold water is suitable for anyone in need of being revitalized from the hot summer days. Truly, if you are in need of a refreshing summer, head off to Camiguin and witness the beauty nature has to offer.___4. The term slacktivist is a blending of two words: slacker and activist. A slacktivist is a person that performs activism online, through social media. A slacktivist's posts are usually about his or her personal advocacies, or criticism of certain personalities, issues, events, or of the government in general. It is a convenient way of voicing protest as it is only done in the comforts of one's home or favorite nook.___5. Reading is an activity that many people do not appreciate. There are so many benefits to reading. For one, reading allows you to travel to different places, time periods, or even settings without leaving the comforts of your own home. You can also meet so many different personalities from whom you can learn useful insights and values.

                            8. Read the following excepts and tell if the information provided shows cause and effect, classification, comparison, definition, or description. ___1. There are four types of transportation available in the metro. A tricycle is a motorcycle with an attached side car. It is used to transport people within villages or to nearby locations. Next, a jeepney is a homegrown transportation that can fit 16 to 22 people at a time. Its body components are usually made of stainless steel with fanciful decors. Inside, passengers will have to sit in a long cushioned bench on each side of the cab. A rather common type is the bus. Buses can fit in a maximum of 60 people at a time, and may follow a city or provincial route. Lastly is the train. Currently. there are four active train lines in Manila: the L RTA lines 1 and 2, the MRT3, and the PNR. Each train line has a specific route and it is the fastest way to get around the city.___2.If I have a choice, I would rather live by the sea than on a mountain. It's nice to wake up to the sound of the lapping waves and the smell of the fresh sea breeze. Unlike in the mountain where there's nothing much to see but trees, trees, and only trees. By the shore, you can do many things. You may dip your feet onto the cold sea water, play with sand, go boating, observe shells the choices are endless! I doubt if you can do as many things on a mountain. I can't think of any activity that I can do if ever I would live on a mountain, that's why I would rather live by the sea.1___3. Camiguin is an island off the coast of Mindanao. It is an island that formed out of one or several volcanic eruptions, thus it's called the island born of fire Despite it being the second smallest province in - the Philippines, it has so many things to offer. It has a beautiful sandbar, called White Island, which is not exactly an island but a landmass made of powdery white sand. The place is ideal for swimming as it is surrounded by clear water and two volcanoes. Another sight to behold in Camiguin is its rich coral and sea life, which may be seen when you go snorkeling in Mantigue Island. It is an islet that also has powdery white sand and blue crystal clear water. Camiguin Island itself boasts of other water forms such as falls, hot, and cold springs. Katibawasan Falls is a 250-feet high falls that cascades onto a rock pool surrounded by orchids, ferns, and boulders. Its cold water is suitable for anyone in need of being revitalized from the hot summer days. Truly, if you are in need of a refreshing summer, head off to Camiguin and witness the beauty nature has to offer.___4. The term slacktivist is a blending of two words: slacker and activist. A slacktivist is a person that performs activism online, through social media. A slacktivist's posts are usually about his or her personal advocacies, or criticism of certain personalities, issues, events, or of the government in general. It is a convenient way of voicing protest as it is only done in the comforts of one's home or favorite nook.___5. Reading is an activity that many people do not appreciate. There are so many benefits to reading. For one, reading allows you to travel to different places, time periods, or even settings without leaving the comforts of your own home. You can also meet so many different personalities from whom you can learn useful insights and values. Another benefit is that it develops your thinking skills. predicting what will happen next, criticizing a character for what he or she has done, and imagining the landscape as it is described are all thinking skills that you use when you read. Lastly, reading makes you a better writer. As you read, you experience how other people write. You learn various ways in which ideas can be expressed, and in learning so, it helps you to choose the best way to write your Own ideas. While it is true that reading is a boring activity, you can never argue against the advantages it brings you.​</h2><br />
