It orbits around the sum of a speed of 18.5miles per second or 67,000 miles per hour. Seventy one percent of the Earth's surface is water: the PacificOcean makes up 70 million squared miles of that coverage. The force of gravity is strong that you would needto travel at a speed at least seven miles per second to escape it. Approximately two million species of animals,plants and other organisms have been identified and named: it is estimated that approximately 50 millionspecies have yet to be identified.If everyone in the United States recycled their newspapers, the lives of 41,000 tress woul be spared.

Emotional Response:3.Tolerance of domestic violence is twice as high as in the rest of the developing world. Incidents of violence against civilians are on the rise. While this litany of suffering is true throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with regard to all these measures life is particularly harsh for people living in the roughly 34% of Africa where states have collapsed to the point of irrelevance. Emotional Response:4.Of the 20 countries in the world with the worst food and nutrition security, 19 are in Africa.Emotional Response:5.Although the poverty rate in Africa has dropped in recent years, rapid population growth means that the number of people suffering poverty keeps growing: from 280 million in 1990 to an estimated 330 million in 2012.Emotional Response:​</a>

                                            Activity 15: Speech WritingPlease refer to the Practical Task.GUIDED GENERALIZATIONIdentify what type of speech is used in the following:1.___________________________________________________________________ Did you know that during the first months of 2004, approximately 200 million birds died or were destroyed in attempt to stop the pandemic of avian influenza? Did you hear that United Nations contributor, Dr. David Navarro, estimated the number of possible human casualties as 5 – 150 million people? Are you aware that since its discovery in the 1990”s, the avian flu has been contracted by more than 100 people, and one of them died? (www.speech.guru)2._____________________________________________________________________ I will finish my speech by one of my favourite quotations. It is taken from the book written by a brilliant mathematician who dared to believe in the incredible. You must have read it in your childhood, but I want you to recall, re-evaluate and remember it. “There is no use trying, said Alice; one can’t believe impossible things. I dare say you haven’t had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast” (Louis Carol).3._________________________________________________________________________ The process itself falls into four simple steps. First, ensure that the wide end of the knot is approximately 30 cm lower than the narrow end and cross the wide end over the narrow one. This will create a loop between the collar and your will-be-tie. Pass the wide end through this loop and then down. So the wide end will again be on top of the narrow one4.__________________________________________________________________________How many of you think guns are necessary to protect yourself? Would you feel the same way if you knew how often guns kill children? I don’t think so! Magazines usually tell people how beautiful and powerful guns are, and never mention how many children get hurt by guns every 0day. But I am here to ask all of you to oppose gun ownership because the fact is that guns are a weapon of violence, they take more lives away every year, and they make people blind to the fact they are killing their own children.5.___________________________________________________________________________The term OCD consists of two defining words: obsession and compulsion. As the word “disorder” speaks for itself, defining obsession and compulsion is crucial for understanding this problem. According to the Merriam-? Webster dictionary, obsession is a persistent disturbing pre-occupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling. Compulsion, in its turn, is an irresistible, persistent impulse to perform an act-often to deal with the obsession. An OCD can be defined as a condition of the mind characterized by a constantly repeating intrusive thought, which can be neutralized only by a certain act or ritual (academichelp.net)​</a>

                                            Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>So each person contributes 182.5*(1/16) lbs of aluminum to the total, or 11.4 lbs. Therefore, 270 million Americans create 11.4*270 million = 3080 million lbs of aluminum each year. 3080 million lbs * (1 ton / 2000 lbs) = 1.54 million anual tons of aluminum to be recycled.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Use compound interest formulas</p><p>Savings instruments in which earnings are continually reinvested, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, use compound interest. The term compounding refers to interest earned not only on the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account.</p><p></p><p>The annual percentage rate (APR) of an account, also called the nominal rate, is the yearly interest rate earned by an investment account. The term nominal is used when the compounding occurs a number of times other than once per year. In fact, when interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective interest rate ends up being greater than the nominal rate! This is a powerful tool for investing.</p><p></p><p>We can calculate the compound interest using the compound interest formula, which is an exponential function of the variables time t, principal P, APR r, and number of compounding periods in a year n:</p><p></p><p>A</p><p>(</p><p>t</p><p>)</p><p>=</p><p>P</p><p>(</p><p>1</p><p>+</p><p>r</p><p>n</p><p>)</p><p>n</p><p>t</p><p>For example, observe the table below, which shows the result of investing $1,000 at 10% for one year. Notice how the value of the account increases as the compounding frequency increases.</p><br />

It orbits around the sum of a speed of 18.5miles per second or 67,000 miles per hour. Seventy one percent of the Earth's surface is water: the PacificOcean makes up 70 million squared miles of that coverage. The force of gravity is strong that you would needto travel at a speed at least seven miles per second to escape it. Approximately two million species of animals,plants and other organisms have been identified and named: it is estimated that approximately 50 millionspecies have yet to be identified.If everyone in the United States recycled their newspapers, the lives of 41,000 tress woul be spared. Onesingle tree can detoxify the air of up of to 60 pounds of pollutants. To make an aluminum can from recycledmaterials takes only five percent of the energy normally needed to make acan, an energy savings Of 95%.The energy saved by recycling just one aluminum can is enough to power a television set for three hours.Recycling glass bottles allows the energy consumption for new glass products to be cut in half.Answer the comprehension check.1.

                            13. Activity 15: Speech WritingPlease refer to the Practical Task.GUIDED GENERALIZATIONIdentify what type of speech is used in the following:1.___________________________________________________________________ Did you know that during the first months of 2004, approximately 200 million birds died or were destroyed in attempt to stop the pandemic of avian influenza? Did you hear that United Nations contributor, Dr. David Navarro, estimated the number of possible human casualties as 5 – 150 million people? Are you aware that since its discovery in the 1990”s, the avian flu has been contracted by more than 100 people, and one of them died? (www.speech.guru)2._____________________________________________________________________ I will finish my speech by one of my favourite quotations. It is taken from the book written by a brilliant mathematician who dared to believe in the incredible. You must have read it in your childhood, but I want you to recall, re-evaluate and remember it. “There is no use trying, said Alice; one can’t believe impossible things. I dare say you haven’t had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast” (Louis Carol).3._________________________________________________________________________ The process itself falls into four simple steps. First, ensure that the wide end of the knot is approximately 30 cm lower than the narrow end and cross the wide end over the narrow one. This will create a loop between the collar and your will-be-tie. Pass the wide end through this loop and then down. So the wide end will again be on top of the narrow one4.__________________________________________________________________________How many of you think guns are necessary to protect yourself? Would you feel the same way if you knew how often guns kill children? I don’t think so! Magazines usually tell people how beautiful and powerful guns are, and never mention how many children get hurt by guns every 0day. But I am here to ask all of you to oppose gun ownership because the fact is that guns are a weapon of violence, they take more lives away every year, and they make people blind to the fact they are killing their own children.5.___________________________________________________________________________The term OCD consists of two defining words: obsession and compulsion. As the word “disorder” speaks for itself, defining obsession and compulsion is crucial for understanding this problem. According to the Merriam-? Webster dictionary, obsession is a persistent disturbing pre-occupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling. Compulsion, in its turn, is an irresistible, persistent impulse to perform an act-often to deal with the obsession. An OCD can be defined as a condition of the mind characterized by a constantly repeating intrusive thought, which can be neutralized only by a certain act or ritual (academichelp.net)​</h2><br />

                            21. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />
