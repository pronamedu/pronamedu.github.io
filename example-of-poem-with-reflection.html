Directions: Respond to the following questions based on the given excerpt from the literary text entitled Literature of Myanmar In the fifteenth century up to the nineteenth century, palm-leaf (scratched with a stylus) and folded-paper literature became common. Such works were filled with Buddhist piety and courtly refinement of language. The authors were monks, educated courtiers, and court . poetesses. Prose works during this period were few, mostly Buddhist scriptures and chronicles of kings. Poetry was varied: there were historical ballads, panegyric odes, the pyo (Buddhist story in verse), and the ya-du (poems of love or nature). The writers also used the mixed style or prose and poetry together. Examples of this are the Yagan, a serio-comic epic, and the Myil- Ta-za, a letter of an abbot to the king. 1. In the reading text, what are the things that reflect the shared heritages of the people of Myanmar? List down at least three of them. 2. What can you say about Burmese literature?​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 2: WHATCHA SAY? There are eight common types of diction as discussed by Master Class (2019). Let us see if you can identify all of them based on the given definition and description below. The word is already revealed but you have to rearrange the letters to get the correct answer. Sounds easy? Give it a try! 1. FAMORL This type of diction refers to the use of sophisticated language, without slang or colloquialisms. It sticks to grammatical rules and uses complicated syntax—the structure of sentences. 2. IFRONMAL It is more conversational and often used in narrative literature. This casual vernacular is representative of how people communicate in real life, which gives an author freedom to depict more realistic characters. Most short stories and novels use this type of diction. 3. PEDNATIC This is when a writer is highly detailed or academic in their writing. Words are chosen specifically to convey only one meaning. It is sometimes used in literature when characters speak in a highly educated manner, as in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. 4. COLLOQUAIL These words or expressions are informal in nature and generally represent a certain region or time. “Ain’t” and “y’all” are examples of expressions for people born in rural areas of the United States. This type of diction adds color and realism to writing. 5. SALNG These are words that originated within a specific culture or subgroup but gained traction. It can be a new word, a shortened or modified word, or words that take on a new meaning. Examples of these are “hip,” which means trendy; and “throw shade,” which is to lob an insult at someone. 6. ASBTARCT This is when a writer uses words to express something intangible, like an idea or an emotion. The phrases used often lack physical detail and specificity because they are things the reader cannot experience through their five senses. 7. CNOCRETE This diction refers to the use of words for their literal meanings and often refer to things that appeal to the senses. The meaning is not open to interpretation because the writer is specific and detailed in their phrasing. For example, the sentence: “I ate an apple.” 8. POEITC This is driven by lyrical words that relate to a specific theme reflected in a poem, and create a euphonious, or harmonious, sound. It usually involves the u​</a>

                                            Directions: Categorize the following words in their respective type of sources. Synthesis is a written discussion taken from different sources. Simply, you take information from different references relevant to your topic and then create an overall point. It is important that you analyze the interrelationship among sources to come up with a good synthesis. In creating synthesis, you must analyze the relationship or connection of these sources and the ideas must be assessed and put in an orderly manner. Primary sources are first-hand or direct accounts from people. Also, these reflect the individual viewpoint and can be either verbal or non-verbal. In literature, those who have written a novel or poem are considered primary resources. The books or article about the novel or poem are labeled as secondary resources. In history, during the Edsa Revolution in 1986, those who have witnessed this event may write or share their experiences through a diary, interview, photographs, speeches, audio recordings, or poem (primary sources). On occasion, those who will study the same topic can analyze or interpret these primary sources and produce another work which will be noted as secondary source. Secondary sources are documents written based from the primary sources. Additionally, synthesis and summary are not the same. In synthesis, you will combine different ideas from relevant sources to come up with a concrete point. On the contrary, summary is plainly an organized written presentation from a single text. The process of synthesizing is normal since you often infer relationship between the movies you have watched with the books that you have read. Also, you may look for the similarities and differences in doing synthesis. Examples are provided below. Articles Diaries Encyclopedia Interview Observation Personal Experience Reviews Textbooks</a>

                            16. ACTIVITY 2: WHATCHA SAY? There are eight common types of diction as discussed by Master Class (2019). Let us see if you can identify all of them based on the given definition and description below. The word is already revealed but you have to rearrange the letters to get the correct answer. Sounds easy? Give it a try! 1. FAMORL This type of diction refers to the use of sophisticated language, without slang or colloquialisms. It sticks to grammatical rules and uses complicated syntax—the structure of sentences. 2. IFRONMAL It is more conversational and often used in narrative literature. This casual vernacular is representative of how people communicate in real life, which gives an author freedom to depict more realistic characters. Most short stories and novels use this type of diction. 3. PEDNATIC This is when a writer is highly detailed or academic in their writing. Words are chosen specifically to convey only one meaning. It is sometimes used in literature when characters speak in a highly educated manner, as in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. 4. COLLOQUAIL These words or expressions are informal in nature and generally represent a certain region or time. “Ain’t” and “y’all” are examples of expressions for people born in rural areas of the United States. This type of diction adds color and realism to writing. 5. SALNG These are words that originated within a specific culture or subgroup but gained traction. It can be a new word, a shortened or modified word, or words that take on a new meaning. Examples of these are “hip,” which means trendy; and “throw shade,” which is to lob an insult at someone. 6. ASBTARCT This is when a writer uses words to express something intangible, like an idea or an emotion. The phrases used often lack physical detail and specificity because they are things the reader cannot experience through their five senses. 7. CNOCRETE This diction refers to the use of words for their literal meanings and often refer to things that appeal to the senses. The meaning is not open to interpretation because the writer is specific and detailed in their phrasing. For example, the sentence: “I ate an apple.” 8. POEITC This is driven by lyrical words that relate to a specific theme reflected in a poem, and create a euphonious, or harmonious, sound. It usually involves the u​</h2><br />

                            29. Directions: Categorize the following words in their respective type of sources. Synthesis is a written discussion taken from different sources. Simply, you take information from different references relevant to your topic and then create an overall point. It is important that you analyze the interrelationship among sources to come up with a good synthesis. In creating synthesis, you must analyze the relationship or connection of these sources and the ideas must be assessed and put in an orderly manner. Primary sources are first-hand or direct accounts from people. Also, these reflect the individual viewpoint and can be either verbal or non-verbal. In literature, those who have written a novel or poem are considered primary resources. The books or article about the novel or poem are labeled as secondary resources. In history, during the Edsa Revolution in 1986, those who have witnessed this event may write or share their experiences through a diary, interview, photographs, speeches, audio recordings, or poem (primary sources). On occasion, those who will study the same topic can analyze or interpret these primary sources and produce another work which will be noted as secondary source. Secondary sources are documents written based from the primary sources. Additionally, synthesis and summary are not the same. In synthesis, you will combine different ideas from relevant sources to come up with a concrete point. On the contrary, summary is plainly an organized written presentation from a single text. The process of synthesizing is normal since you often infer relationship between the movies you have watched with the books that you have read. Also, you may look for the similarities and differences in doing synthesis. Examples are provided below.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are two types of syntheses: explanatory syntheses and argumentative syntheses. Explanatory syntheses seek to bring sources together to explain a perspective and the reasoning behind it. Argumentative syntheses seek to bring sources together to make an argument. Both types of synthesis involve looking for relationships between sources and drawing conclusions.</p><p>In order to successfully synthesize your sources, you might begin by grouping your sources by topic and looking for connections. For example, if you were researching the pros and cons of encouraging healthy eating in children, you would want to separate your sources to find which ones agree with each other and which ones disagree.</p><p>After you have a good idea of what your sources are saying, you want to construct your body paragraphs in a way that acknowledges different sources and highlights where you can draw new conclusions.</p><p></p><br />
