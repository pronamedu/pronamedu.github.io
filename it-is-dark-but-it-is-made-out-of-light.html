                                            HELP fast pls!! Ill give brainliest for who answers first(excerpt from) The Creation James Weldon Johnson  AND God stepped out on space,And He looked around and said,“I’m lonely—I’ll make me a world.”And far as the eye of God could see5Darkness covered everything,Blacker than a hundred midnightsDown in a cypress swamp.Then God smiled,And the light broke,10And the darkness rolled up on one side,And the light stood shining on the other,And God said, “That’s good!”Then God reached out and took the light in His hands,And God rolled the light around in His hands15Until He made the sun;And He set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.And the light that was left from making the sunGod gathered it up in a shining ballAnd flung it against the darkness,20Spangling the night with the moon and stars.Then down betweenThe darkness and the lightHe hurled the world;And God said, “That’s good!”25Then God himself stepped down—And the sun was on His right hand,And the moon was on His left;The stars were clustered about His head,And the earth was under His feet.30And God walked, and where He trodHis footsteps hollowed the valleys ouyAnd bulged the mountains up.Then He stopped and looked and sawThat the earth was hot and barren.35So God stepped over to the edge of the worldAnd He spat out the seven seas;He batted His eyes, and the lightnings flashed;He clapped His hands, and the thunders rolled;And the waters above the earth came down,40The cooling waters came down.How does the poem's "free verse" structure help to express the theme of the poem? a) its lack of rhyme scheme shows that god prefers chaos. b) its rhyme scheme shows god's interest in order and harmony. c) its tight structure shows that god has to obey certain rules. d) its lack of structure underlines the fact that god can do anything.</a>

                                            THE SONG IS DEMONS
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale
I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide</a>

                                            Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</a>

This energy is both (1) and electrical. There are many different types of electromagnetic (EM) waves. Most of them cannot be seen by humans. Our eyes see only a small (2) of EM waves called visible light. Visible light is made up of different colors. The colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The colors are due to the different(3)of light. The (4)thewavelength, the less energy the wave has. The shorter the wavelength, the more energy it has. The (5) wavelength of visible light looks red to us. The shortest of visible light looks violet to us.(6) Here are some properties of light:Light travels out in all directions from its source What are some sources of light? The sun is our main source of light on Earth. Some other sources are other stars and fire.Light is made of little particles called photons. A photon is the smallestin waves.Light travels in straight lines called rays.(7) particle of electromagnetic radiation. These particles travelLight travels at the speed of light" This speed is about 186,000 m; per second (670 million miles per hour), or about 300,000 kilometers per second The speed of light is sort of a "Speed limit" So far, nothing has been found that can travel(8)\ faster than light.Light can be absorbed. Absorbed light energy is converted into some other form, such as thermal or heat energy. You can test this by putting a piece of black construction paper and a piece of white construction paper on a sunny windowsill. Place a thermometer for measuring (9) or room temperature under each piece of paper. Wait a few hours, and then check the two temperatures. The thermometer underneath the black paper should be hotter than the one under the white paper. This is the reason people tend to wear dark colors in the (10) colors absorb light, (11) and white or light colors in the summer. Dark us keep warmer in the winter. In the summer, light colors absorb little of the sun's energy. keeping us (12) Light can be reflected. If you shine light on a surface, some of that light will bounce off, or be reflected by, the surface. The law of reflection tells us that light will always be reflected by asurface at the same angle at which it hits the surface.Light can be refracted. Light always travels in straight (13)\ \ But when it passes from one medium into another, it changes direction slightly. Refraction occurs because light travels at different speeds through different materials. When light passes through air into water, for example, it slows down. The light rays are bent slightly. You can see this if you put a pencil into a half-glassful of water. The pencil looks bent or broken at the water (14) This is due to (15)Objects that we see get their color from the light they reflect. A green object looks green because it absorbs all other colors but reflects green.Light can be transmitted. Sometimes light passes through matter. This is called transmission. Light is transmitted through some matter more easily than through other kinds of matter. Light is transmitted through water, air, and glass very easily. These materials are said to be transparent Transparent materials (16) light to be transmitted through them casily. Some matter transmits some, but not all, of the light that hits it. This(17) material are (18) Galactic is called translucent. Some examples of translucent x+d\ paper or glass blocks. Opaque matter does not transmit any light. You cannot see through it because light doesn't pass through it. A book and a brick wall are two examples of opaque (19)​</a>

                                            QUALITIES OF COLORSHue Saturation Value1. Hue – is just another word for color, and it generally refers to a specific slice of the color wheel.2. Saturation – is the intensity of a color. It is the brightness or dullness of a color. Highly saturated colors are those that appear bright and pure. Desaturated colors look dull, muted, or grayed out.3. Value – refers to the lightness or darkness of a color. The scale of the value colors is from the very lightest tint to the very darkest of the shade.COLOR SCHEMES1. Monochromatic – means one (mono) color (chroma). It is made up of one color and its shades and tints2. Analogous – colors next to each other on the color wheel3. Complementary – colors found directly across from each other on the color wheel. These colors provide strong contrast.4. Split complementary – are made up of color and its complements closest analogous colors5. Triads – consist of three colors found on the color wheel that are equally spaced apart from each other.6. Tetradic – a special variant of dual color scheme, with an equal distance between all colors. All colors are distributed evenly around the color wheel, causing there to be no clear dominance of one color.​</a>

If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you
We'll find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me like one, two, three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh, yeah
If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Every day I will remind you, oh
We'll find out what we're made of

Ill give brainliest for who answers first(excerpt from) The Creation James Weldon Johnson  AND God stepped out on space,And He looked around and said,“I’m lonely—I’ll make me a world.”And far as the eye of God could see5Darkness covered everything,Blacker than a hundred midnightsDown in a cypress swamp.Then God smiled,And the light broke,10And the darkness rolled up on one side,And the light stood shining on the other,And God said, “That’s good!”Then God reached out and took the light in His hands,And God rolled the light around in His hands15Until He made the sun;And He set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.And the light that was left from making the sunGod gathered it up in a shining ballAnd flung it against the darkness,20Spangling the night with the moon and stars.Then down betweenThe darkness and the lightHe hurled the world;And God said, “That’s good!”25Then God himself stepped down—And the sun was on His right hand,And the moon was on His left;The stars were clustered about His head,And the earth was under His feet.30And God walked, and where He trodHis footsteps hollowed the valleys ouyAnd bulged the mountains up.Then He stopped and looked and sawThat the earth was hot and barren.35So God stepped over to the edge of the worldAnd He spat out the seven seas;He batted His eyes, and the lightnings flashed;He clapped His hands, and the thunders rolled;And the waters above the earth came down,40The cooling waters came down.How does the poem's "free verse" structure help to express the theme of the poem? a) its lack of rhyme scheme shows that god prefers chaos. b) its rhyme scheme shows god's interest in order and harmony. c) its tight structure shows that god has to obey certain rules. d) its lack of structure underlines the fact that god can do anything.</h2><br />

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold

Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale
I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside

                            12. Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</h2><br />

                            14. longestmaterialsoutdoorgalacticlineshelpingrefractionportionallowwaxedwavelengthlongerwavelengthsmagneticlinepossiblewintertimematerialcoolerLight is one form of energy that travels in electromagnetic waves. This energy is both (1) and electrical. There are many different types of electromagnetic (EM) waves. Most of them cannot be seen by humans. Our eyes see only a small (2) of EM waves called visible light. Visible light is made up of different colors. The colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The colors are due to the different(3)of light. The (4)thewavelength, the less energy the wave has. The shorter the wavelength, the more energy it has. The (5) wavelength of visible light looks red to us. The shortest of visible light looks violet to us.(6) Here are some properties of light:Light travels out in all directions from its source What are some sources of light? The sun is our main source of light on Earth. Some other sources are other stars and fire.Light is made of little particles called photons. A photon is the smallestin waves.Light travels in straight lines called rays.(7) particle of electromagnetic radiation. These particles travelLight travels at the speed of light" This speed is about 186,000 m; per second (670 million miles per hour), or about 300,000 kilometers per second The speed of light is sort of a "Speed limit" So far, nothing has been found that can travel(8)\ faster than light.Light can be absorbed. Absorbed light energy is converted into some other form, such as thermal or heat energy. You can test this by putting a piece of black construction paper and a piece of white construction paper on a sunny windowsill. Place a thermometer for measuring (9) or room temperature under each piece of paper. Wait a few hours, and then check the two temperatures. The thermometer underneath the black paper should be hotter than the one under the white paper. This is the reason people tend to wear dark colors in the (10) colors absorb light, (11) and white or light colors in the summer. Dark us keep warmer in the winter. In the summer, light colors absorb little of the sun's energy. keeping us (12) Light can be reflected. If you shine light on a surface, some of that light will bounce off, or be reflected by, the surface. The law of reflection tells us that light will always be reflected by asurface at the same angle at which it hits the surface.Light can be refracted. Light always travels in straight (13)\ \ But when it passes from one medium into another, it changes direction slightly. Refraction occurs because light travels at different speeds through different materials. When light passes through air into water, for example, it slows down. The light rays are bent slightly. You can see this if you put a pencil into a half-glassful of water. The pencil looks bent or broken at the water (14) This is due to (15)Objects that we see get their color from the light they reflect. A green object looks green because it absorbs all other colors but reflects green.Light can be transmitted. Sometimes light passes through matter. This is called transmission. Light is transmitted through some matter more easily than through other kinds of matter. Light is transmitted through water, air, and glass very easily. These materials are said to be transparent Transparent materials (16) light to be transmitted through them casily. Some matter transmits some, but not all, of the light that hits it.

Count on Me
Bruno Mars
If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you
We'll find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me like one, two, three
I'll be there
And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh, yeah
If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Every day I will remind you, oh
We'll find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends...
