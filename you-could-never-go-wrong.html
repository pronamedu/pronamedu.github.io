                                            The Elephant and the Blind Men Once upon a time, an elephant came to a small. People had read and heard of elephants but no one in the town had ever seen one. Thus, a huge crowd gather around the elephant, and it was as occasion for great fun, especially for the children. Flve blind men also lived in that town, and consequently, they also heard about the elephant. They had never seen an elephant before, and they were eager to find out about the elephant. Then someone suggested that the blind men go and feel the elephant with their hands. They could then get an idea of what an elephant looks like. The five blind men went to the center of the town where all the people made room for them to touch the elephant. Later on, they sat down and began to discuss their experiences. One blind man, who had touched the trunk of the elephant, said that the elephant must be like a thick tree branch. Another touched the tall said the elephant probably looked like a snake or rope. The third man, who touched the ear, said that the elephant must be a pillar. The fourth man, who touched the ear, sald that the elephant must be like a huge fan. The fifth, who touched the side, said It must be like a wall. They sat for hours and argued, each one sure that his view, but no one was quite willing to listen to the others. Finally, they decided to go to the wise man of the village and ask him who was correct. The wise man said, “Each one of you is correct and each one of you is wrong because each one of you had only touched a part of the elephant's body. Thus, you only have a partial view of the animal. If you put your partial views together, you will get an idea of what an elephant looks like." This story will help asses your different perspective on the community.

                                            When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we are good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids
Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never traveled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on this stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them
When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids
Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I'll be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids they started bugging me
But now they're all standing right in front of me
When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids
I know which place I'm from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and struggling
That's where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That's why I'm always keep them tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?
You know what she told me?
My mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

                                            DISCUSSIONBring in the ChickenOnce, long ago in Poland, there was a man who felt depressed. He went to his rabbi to tell him hisproblems."Rabbi," the man said, "I am so unhappy.""What is wrong?" said the rabbi"My house is so small. It only has one room. Not only do my wife and our five children live in it butalso my mother-in-law. What can I do?""Bring the chickens into the house," said the rabbi.The man went home. Everyone who knew the rabbi trusts that he was a very wise man. So the mandid as the rabbi said. A week later he came back to the rabbi."Rabbi," said the man, “it is worse with the chickens in the house. They squawk and flap around anddirty the floor. I am going to go crazy. What can I do?""Now," said the rabbi, "bring the pig into the house."The man did as the rabbi said, but it was only four days later this time when he went back to the"Rabbi," he said, “I thought it was bad with the chickens, but now with the pig it is even worse. I amalways tripping over it. And it tips over our table while we are eating. I cannot imagine that anyman could have a life that is worse than mine. What can I do?"Hmmm," said the rabbi. “Bring the cow into the house."The man went home and did as the rabbi told him, but he was back the very next day.“Rabbi," he said, “my house is like a barnyard. It is never quiet. There is no room to move now thatthe cow is in the house. I no longer worry about going crazy. I am crazy. Rabbi, I tell you, unless youcan help me. What can I do?"The rabbi smiled. "Ah," he said, "now take out the chickens."That story Dan Jacobsen told me made me laugh. It also made me realize that as many troubles as Ithought I had, thing could always be worse. But if I just solved one of those problems, things wouldbe better. To this day, whenever I feel overwhelmed, I only have to remember those words: “Nowrabbi.take out the chickens."ctivity 1. Answer the following questions:1. What was the problem of the man in the story that you read?2. Why did the man decide to ask the advice of the rabbi?3.What advice was given to the depressed and unhappy man? What makes the anecdote humorous?​</a>

                                            THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT Mrs. Santos was a widow who was left with three young boys to take care of. Her husband had left her with a very meager savings not enough to bring up their children comfortably and decently. To the best of her ability, she tried to raise them in a God-fearing home. She worked hard by washing clothes and selling rice cakes in the neighborhood. She tried to save too for the rainy days. Mrs. Santos had trouble with one of her sons. He always find the secret places where she hid her money and would take from it the amount he wanted. This happened several times and no amount of scolding or punishment could change the boy. Finally, in desperation, the mother got a piece of paper and printed on it in bold letters, "Thou shalt not steal." Placing it on top of the box which contained the money, she hid it in a new place. Again, the boy found the box where the money was kept. He saw and read the piece of paper with The Sixth Commandment written on it. The good within him prevailed over his mischief. He shuddered at the thought that he would again be breaking God's commandment. He laid down the box without opening it and left feeling guilty for his past deeds. A few days later, upon returning from the market, the mother noticed that the box had again been found. Everything inside it, however, was intact. Not a centavo was missing. "Incredibly true, everything accounted for," she mused. The boy saw his mother examining the box. Quickly he approached her, knelt down before her, and begged for forgiveness. The mother was touched by the boy's act of repentance. She told him, "My son, I know that God within you will not allow you to do such a thing. Your good self will always prevail over your folly. From now on, always think several times before doing something. Ask yourself, "Will I be breaking one of God's commandments?" By living up to God's commandment you can never go wrong."Questions:1. What was Mrs. Santos' problem?2. Describe the sixth commandment.3. How did the son ask for forgiveness?4. Aside from washing clothes, how else did Mrs. Santos earn some money?5. What kind of a mother is Mrs. Santos?6. How do you think will her sons grow up?7. What advice can you give to the kids who go against the sixth commandment?​</a>

The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</a>

                            4. The Elephant and the Blind Men Once upon a time, an elephant came to a small. People had read and heard of elephants but no one in the town had ever seen one. Thus, a huge crowd gather around the elephant, and it was as occasion for great fun, especially for the children. Flve blind men also lived in that town, and consequently, they also heard about the elephant. They had never seen an elephant before, and they were eager to find out about the elephant. Then someone suggested that the blind men go and feel the elephant with their hands. They could then get an idea of what an elephant looks like. The five blind men went to the center of the town where all the people made room for them to touch the elephant. Later on, they sat down and began to discuss their experiences. One blind man, who had touched the trunk of the elephant, said that the elephant must be like a thick tree branch. Another touched the tall said the elephant probably looked like a snake or rope. The third man, who touched the ear, said that the elephant must be a pillar. The fourth man, who touched the ear, sald that the elephant must be like a huge fan. The fifth, who touched the side, said It must be like a wall. They sat for hours and argued, each one sure that his view, but no one was quite willing to listen to the others. Finally, they decided to go to the wise man of the village and ask him who was correct. The wise man said, “Each one of you is correct and each one of you is wrong because each one of you had only touched a part of the elephant's body. Thus, you only have a partial view of the animal. If you put your partial views together, you will get an idea of what an elephant looks like." This story will help asses your different perspective on the community.

                            6. When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we are good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids
Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never traveled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on this stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them
When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids
Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I'll be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids they started bugging me
But now they're all standing right in front of me
When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids
I know which place I'm from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and struggling
That's where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That's why I'm always keep them tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?
You know what she told me?
My mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids
When mama said that it was okay
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba

When mama said that it was okay

                            9. DISCUSSIONBring in the ChickenOnce, long ago in Poland, there was a man who felt depressed. He went to his rabbi to tell him hisproblems."Rabbi," the man said, "I am so unhappy.""What is wrong?" said the rabbi"My house is so small. It only has one room. Not only do my wife and our five children live in it butalso my mother-in-law. What can I do?""Bring the chickens into the house," said the rabbi.The man went home. Everyone who knew the rabbi trusts that he was a very wise man. So the mandid as the rabbi said. A week later he came back to the rabbi."Rabbi," said the man, “it is worse with the chickens in the house. They squawk and flap around anddirty the floor. I am going to go crazy. What can I do?""Now," said the rabbi, "bring the pig into the house."The man did as the rabbi said, but it was only four days later this time when he went back to the"Rabbi," he said, “I thought it was bad with the chickens, but now with the pig it is even worse. I amalways tripping over it. And it tips over our table while we are eating. I cannot imagine that anyman could have a life that is worse than mine. What can I do?"Hmmm," said the rabbi. “Bring the cow into the house."The man went home and did as the rabbi told him, but he was back the very next day.“Rabbi," he said, “my house is like a barnyard. It is never quiet. There is no room to move now thatthe cow is in the house. I no longer worry about going crazy. I am crazy. Rabbi, I tell you, unless youcan help me. What can I do?"The rabbi smiled. "Ah," he said, "now take out the chickens."That story Dan Jacobsen told me made me laugh. It also made me realize that as many troubles as Ithought I had, thing could always be worse. But if I just solved one of those problems, things wouldbe better. To this day, whenever I feel overwhelmed, I only have to remember those words: “Nowrabbi.take out the chickens."ctivity 1. Answer the following questions:1.

                            10. THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT Mrs. Santos was a widow who was left with three young boys to take care of. Her husband had left her with a very meager savings not enough to bring up their children comfortably and decently. To the best of her ability, she tried to raise them in a God-fearing home. She worked hard by washing clothes and selling rice cakes in the neighborhood. She tried to save too for the rainy days. Mrs. Santos had trouble with one of her sons. He always find the secret places where she hid her money and would take from it the amount he wanted. This happened several times and no amount of scolding or punishment could change the boy. Finally, in desperation, the mother got a piece of paper and printed on it in bold letters, "Thou shalt not steal." Placing it on top of the box which contained the money, she hid it in a new place. Again, the boy found the box where the money was kept. He saw and read the piece of paper with The Sixth Commandment written on it. The good within him prevailed over his mischief. He shuddered at the thought that he would again be breaking God's commandment. He laid down the box without opening it and left feeling guilty for his past deeds. A few days later, upon returning from the market, the mother noticed that the box had again been found. Everything inside it, however, was intact. Not a centavo was missing. "Incredibly true, everything accounted for," she mused. The boy saw his mother examining the box. Quickly he approached her, knelt down before her, and begged for forgiveness. The mother was touched by the boy's act of repentance. She told him, "My son, I know that God within you will not allow you to do such a thing. Your good self will always prevail over your folly. From now on, always think several times before doing something. Ask yourself, "Will I be breaking one of God's commandments?" By living up to God's commandment you can never go wrong."Questions:1.

                            12. How did Juan achieve the comforts in life? Do you think
he would still have experienced the same comforts had he
not encountered the magic tree? Explain your answer.
The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</h2><br />
