                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Man's loves, griefs, thoughts, dreams, and aspirations written in beautiful language are literature.</p><p></p><p>2. The expression of feelings through literature may be through love, sorrow, happiness, hate, anger, pity, contempt, or revenge.</p><p></p><p>3.Another meaning of literature would be "an expression of feelings and emotions of people in response to their everyday efforts to live, to be happy in their environment, and after struggles, reach their Creator."</p><p></p><p>4.Prose includes novels, biographies, short stories, contemporary dramas, legends, fables, essays, anecdotes, news, and speeches.</p><p></p><p>5.There are three types of poetry: narrative, lyric, and dramatic.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.The original sentence used "dream" and "aspiration" in different grammatical forms than the other listed items, which made the sentence unparallel. To make it parallel, we changed "dream" to "dreams" and "aspiration" to "aspirations" so that all the items are in the same grammatical form.</p><p>2.The original sentence listed "sorrow" and "hate" as nouns, but used "happy" as an adjective, which made the sentence unparallel. To make it parallel, we changed "happy" to "happiness" to make it a noun, like the other listed items.</p><p>3.The original sentence used "his" to refer to people, which is not gender-neutral. To make it more inclusive, we changed "his" to "their."

To make it parallel, we changed "biography" to "biographies" and "short story" to "short stories" to match the others.</p><p>5.The original sentence used "drama" instead of "dramatic," which was not parallel to "narrative" and "lyric," which are both adjectives. To make it parallel, we changed "drama" to "dramatic," which is an adjective like the others.</p><br />

You may use the space below or on any writing paper you prefer - basta clean and creative. (Analysis 10pts, Message 10pts, Art 10pts = 30 pts.)​</h2><br />
                        Answer: ✏<p></p><p><strong>"Love Letter for Mother Earth"</strong></p><p></p><p>We are all aware that Earth is the only planet on which life exists.</p><p>Since of now, it is apparent that this planet has been a gift to us humans and other living things, as it provides us with all of the resources we require. Everything we need is provided by Earth, from air to water to food, which is why we call it Mother Earth. We would not have existed if not for the beauty of the environment and the abundance of resources available on the planet. But, what have we done to our mother earth? We have exploited the earth for our own ends, and now the planet we call our mother faces the threat of extinction of life on its soil due to our bad behavior. Pollution levels are at an all-time high, and resources are rapidly depleting. To save our mother earth, we must take adequate precautions. Every day, we generate tons of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste and dispose of it irresponsibly. She is being suffocated by smoke and harmful gases emitted by our homes, vehicles, and industries. We are recklessly disposing of dirty sewage, drainage, and even chemicals, despite the fact that more than 7 billion humans, as well as all plants and animals on the planet, rely on water for survival. For agriculture and settlement, we destroy forests. We construct massive structures, roads, and factories that exceed her carrying capacity. The construction of nuclear reactors has a significant impact on the environment and human lives. Air pollution causes airborne diseases such as asthma in humans and animals, as well as disrupting the entire metabolism process in plants. In humans, noise pollution causes insomnia and heart disease. Deforestation causes natural disasters such as floods, soil erosion, and so on, as well as temperature rise and altered rainfall distribution, drought, loss of valuable biodiversity, decreased oxygen density, and so on. The world's most pressing issues at the moment are "Climate Change &amp; Greenhouse Effect." Thus, for the sake of our planet's sustainability, I promise to fulfill my responsibilities as a global citizen to Mother Nature in order to protect my living planet from deterioration and to leave a clean and green planet to future generations. Our individual efforts may appear insignificant, but if thousands of young people act together to protect nature, our efforts will one day be a significant step toward protecting our motherland Earth from destruction.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
