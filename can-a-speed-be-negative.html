                                            Acceleration Worksheet. 14.2 Acceleration Acceleration is the rate of change in the speed of an object. To determine the rate of acceleration, you use the formula below. The units for acceleration are meters per second per second or m/s². Final speed- Beginning speed Time Given Beginning speed = 2.0 m/s Final speed 10.0 m/s Change in time = 3 seconds Relationship a = A positive value for acceleration shows speeding up, and negative value for acceleration shows slowing down. Slowing down is also called deceleration. The acceleration formula can be rearranged to solve for other variables such as final speed (v2) and time (1). v₂ = ₁ + (axt) 2-1 a Acceleration = EXAMPLES 1. A skater increases her velocity from 2.0 m/s to 10.0 m/s in 3.0 seconds. What is the skater's acceleration? Looking for Solution Acceleration of the skater 22-1 t a = Looking for The time to reach the final speed. t = P2-P1 t Given Beginning speed = 8.0 m/s; Final speed = 25.0 m/s Acceleration = 3.0 m/s² Relationship V2-1 a Name: Date: Acceleration = 2. A car accelerates at a rate of 3.0 m/s². If its original speed is 8.0 m/s, how many seconds will it take the car to reach a final speed of 25.0 m/s? Solution 10.0 m/s - 2.0 m/s 3 s The acceleration of the skater is 2.7 meters per second per second. Time = = 2.7 m/s2 25.0 m/s 8.0 m/s 3.0 m/s = 5.7 s The time for the car to reach its final speed is 5.7 seconds.​</a>

                                            TRUE OR FALSE 13. Distance gives complete information of the route followed by the body, while displacement does not give complete information of the route followed by the body. 14. Distance is always positive, cannot be negative and zero. 15. The unit used to express speed is meters per second (m/s), it can also be expressed in miles per hour (mi/hr or mph), kilometers per hour (km/hr or kph). 16. In calculating for average speed, you will divide the total distance travelled by the total time travelled. 17. The unit used for velocity is the same as the unit of speed like meter per second, kilometer per hour, and miles per hour. 18. If you are not changing your speed, and you are not changing your direction, then you simply cannot be accelerating, no matter how fast you are going. 19. Time is plotted on the Y-axis, while distance is plotted on the X-axis. 20. A speed-time graph shows how the speed of a moving object changes with time. 21. Speed-time graph is different from velocity-time graph. 22. In a given time, if the distance the object moves is changed (getting larger), it is accelerating. 23. A straight horizontal line on a speed-time graph means that speed is constant. It is not changing over time. Therefore, it has no acceleration. 24. A downward sloping line means that the object is slowing down. 25. A horizontal line means the object is moving at a constant speed with zero acceleration. MIT​</a>

Displacement is a vector quantity having both magnitude and direction. 9. Speed is defined as the distance travelled divided by the time of travel. 10. Units like kilometers per hour (km/h), miles per hour (mi/h), and meters per second (m/s) can be used to express speed. 11. We use the term velocity to describe the speed with direction. 12.

                            11. Acceleration Worksheet. 14.2 Acceleration Acceleration is the rate of change in the speed of an object. To determine the rate of acceleration, you use the formula below. The units for acceleration are meters per second per second or m/s². Final speed- Beginning speed Time Given Beginning speed = 2.0 m/s Final speed 10.0 m/s Change in time = 3 seconds Relationship a = A positive value for acceleration shows speeding up, and negative value for acceleration shows slowing down. Slowing down is also called deceleration. The acceleration formula can be rearranged to solve for other variables such as final speed (v2) and time (1). v₂ = ₁ + (axt) 2-1 a Acceleration = EXAMPLES 1. A skater increases her velocity from 2.0 m/s to 10.0 m/s in 3.0 seconds. What is the skater's acceleration? Looking for Solution Acceleration of the skater 22-1 t a = Looking for The time to reach the final speed. t = P2-P1 t Given Beginning speed = 8.0 m/s; Final speed = 25.0 m/s Acceleration = 3.0 m/s² Relationship V2-1 a Name: Date: Acceleration = 2. A car accelerates at a rate of 3.0 m/s². If its original speed is 8.0 m/s, how many seconds will it take the car to reach a final speed of 25.0 m/s? Solution 10.0 m/s - 2.0 m/s 3 s The acceleration of the skater is 2.7 meters per second per second. Time = = 2.7 m/s2 25.0 m/s 8.0 m/s 3.0 m/s = 5.7 s The time for the car to reach its final speed is 5.7 seconds.​</h2><br />

                            12. TRUE OR FALSE 13. Distance gives complete information of the route followed by the body, while displacement does not give complete information of the route followed by the body. 14. Distance is always positive, cannot be negative and zero. 15. The unit used to express speed is meters per second (m/s), it can also be expressed in miles per hour (mi/hr or mph), kilometers per hour (km/hr or kph). 16. In calculating for average speed, you will divide the total distance travelled by the total time travelled. 17. The unit used for velocity is the same as the unit of speed like meter per second, kilometer per hour, and miles per hour. 18. If you are not changing your speed, and you are not changing your direction, then you simply cannot be accelerating, no matter how fast you are going. 19. Time is plotted on the Y-axis, while distance is plotted on the X-axis. 20. A speed-time graph shows how the speed of a moving object changes with time. 21. Speed-time graph is different from velocity-time graph. 22. In a given time, if the distance the object moves is changed (getting larger), it is accelerating. 23. A straight horizontal line on a speed-time graph means that speed is constant. It is not changing over time. Therefore, it has no acceleration. 24. A downward sloping line means that the object is slowing down. 25. A horizontal line means the object is moving at a constant speed with zero acceleration. MIT​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1 </strong><strong>-</strong><strong>B </strong></p><p><strong>In mechanics, acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time. Accelerations are vector quantities (in that they have magnitude and direction). The orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object.</strong></p><br />
