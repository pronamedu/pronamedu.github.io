He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</a>

Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

Another reason why dogs make good pets is because they help with loneliness. Having a dog as a companion can be very comforting. So, adopt a dog now. 3. Plants are called producers because they make their own food. This is how plants produce its food. Plants use energy from sunlight to tum carbon dioxide and water into sugar for food. The leaves of green plants contain chlorophyll which absorbs sunlight for producing food. This helps them to make food for the plant. 4. Regular bicycling has many health benefits. Bicycling increases muscle strength and flexibility. It may help in preventing certain diseases. It may also decrease body fat and stress levels. Based on some studies, 30-minute bicycling for a day burns over 50% more calories. Bicycling may also improve posture, coordination, and joint mobility. One day, 5. There was a young girl named Rina.

Janna's Experiment Janna noticed that there are crushed eggshells in the pots of orchids in her neighbor's garden. She wondered why eggshells are placed in the pots. She observed the orchid leaves in the garden and she saw that the leaves are dark green in color. She wants to find out if the eggshells affect the Bleen icon growth of the orchids in the garden. Janna guessed that orchids with eggshells will have greener leaves than those without eggshells because as the eggshells decompose, minerals in the shells and in the membrane will provide nutrients to the growing orchids. Greener leaves mean the orchids are healthy. Janna asked her father to help her prepare a greenhouse to conduct an experiment. They purchased 10 pots of orchids of the same variety, size and age. She arranged the 5 pots in the left corner of the greenhouse and another 5 pots in the right corner. Then, she made an initial record of the appearance of the orchids in her notebook. Together with her father, they collected some eggshells, crushed them, and distributed them equally among the 5 pots in the right corner. All the orchids were taken care of in the same way for 45 days. In the first and second week of observations, there were no manifestations of changes in the orchids but the succeeding observations started to show changes in the color of the orchid's leaves. After 45 days, Janna noticed that the leaves of the orchids with eggshells were darker green in color than those without eggshells. www Janna discovered that eggshells can be used as fertilizers for some varieties of orchids as shown by the greener color of their leaves. 2. Answer the given questions. 1. What are the initial observations in the situation? 2. Can you identify the real problem in the experiment? City of Good Character DISCIPLINE GOOD TASTE EXCELLENCE 3.

                                            HOW THE WORLD BEGANA POPULAR BUKIDNON FOLKTALEA long, long time ago, when there was yet no world, there were three gods who lived in a small circular space of great brightness. Called a banting, and encircled by a rainbow, the space was just large enough for the two gods, Magbabaya and Dadanyahan, to sit across each other. The third god, the winged Makabughaw, sat precariously between the two, and had to flap his wings continuously to maintain his balance. Taking pity on Makabughaw, the one-headed Magbabaya (meaning your will be done) decided to build an extension so the poor Makabughaw could rest. To do this, he had to scoop soil from under the ten-headed Dadanyahan. He asked Makabughaw to do this for him. After studying the situation, Makabughaw swooped into Dadanyahans mouths and dived right through him so he could get soil from that point. He has the soil to Magbabaya who created earth from it.  But the earth was dry. How could it have turned lush and green? As Magbabaya puzzled over the problem, he happened to glance at Dadanyahans ten drooling mouths. Suddenly, he realized where he could get enough water to sprinkle over the earth. Dadanyahan agreed to the plan. Magbabaya blessed Dadanyahans saliva and the rain poured. Water washed over the earth. It shaped the mountains, hills, valleys, and plains; it made the streams, rivers and huge seas and oceans. Soon, vegetation began to sprout and grow. But this huge garden needed someone to take care of it. The two gods scooped some earth, and with the help from Dadanyahans saliva, turned it into sticky clay to form a figure. They collected wood for its bones, rattan from its blood vessels, and water for its blood. They molded seven figures in Magbabayas image. After the seventh figure was molded, Magbabaya had to leave to take care of a few other things. But before leaving, he told Dadanyahan not to tamper with the figures. Left alone with the figures, Dadanyahan could not help touching them up the way he thought they should look. Magbabaya returned to find Dadanyahan using his creative talents on the figures. This triggered a fight between them which Makabughaw tried to arbitrate in vain. The two gods dueled with each other until their metal weapons sank to the ground. These became the minerals that the human race later forged into its own weapons and mode of transport. Finally, the warring God reached an agreement. Because Dadanyahan had made the final form of the figures, he kept six figures while Magbabaya had only one since it was he who thought up the idea. Dadanyahans six figures became the various engkanto or guardians of the soil, water, and marine life, the plants, forests, and creatures of thej forest. Magbabayas lone figure became the first human being. The bits of clay cut from the figures as they were being modeled became the lower forms of animals. And thus did the world begin.Questions1.

He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.

                            5. read the story. copy lines from the story that shows hyperbole and lines that shows litotes.THE WONDERFUL PEAR-TREEOnce upon a time a countryman came into the town on market-day, and brought a load of very special pears with him to sell. He set up his barrow in a good corner, and soon had a great crowd round him; for everyone knew he always sold extra fine pears, though he did also ask an extra high price. Now, while he was crying up his fruit, a poor, old, ragged, hungry-looking priest stopped just in front of the barrow, and very humbly begged him to give him one of the pears. But the countryman, who was very mean and very nasty-tempered, wouldn't hear of giving him any, and as the priest didn't seem inclined to move on, he began calling him all the bad names he could think of. "Good sir," said the priest, "you have got hundreds of pears on your barrow. I only ask you for one. You would never even know you had lost one. Really, you needn't get angry.""Give him a pear that is going bad; that will make him happy," said one of the crowd. "The old man is quite right; you'd never miss it.""I've said I won't, and I won't!" cried the countryman: and all the people close by began shouting, first one thing, and then another, until the constable of the market, hearing the hubbub, hurried up; and when he had made out what was the matter, pulled some cash out of his purse, bought a ​pear, and gave it to the priest. For he was afraid that the noise would come to the ears of the mandarin who was just being carried down the street.The old priest took the pear with a low bow, and held it up in front of the crowd, saying, "You all know that I have no home, no parents, no children, no clothes of my own, no food, because I gave everything up when I became a priest. So it puzzles me how anyone can be so selfish and so stingy as to refuse to give me one single pear. Now I am quite a different sort of man from this countryman. I have got here some perfectly exquisite pears, and I shall feel most deeply honoured if you will accept them from me." "Why on earth didn't you eat them yourself, instead of begging for one?" asked a man in the crowd. "Ah," answered the priest, "I must grow them first." So he ate up the pear, only leaving a single pip. Then he took a pick which was fastened across his back, dug a deep hole in the ground at his feet, and planted the pip, which he covered all over with earth. "Will some one fetch me some hot water to water this?" he asked. The people, who were crowding round, thought he was only joking, but one of them ran and fetched a kettle of boiling water and gave it to the priest, who very carefully poured it over the place where he had sowed the pip. Then, almost while he was pouring, they saw, first a tiny green sprout, and then another, come pushing their heads above the ground; then one leaf uncurled, and then another, while the shoots kept growing taller and taller; then there stood before them a young tree with a ​few branches with a few leaves; then more leaves; then flowers; and last of all clusters of huge, ripe, sweet-smelling pears weighing the branches down to the ground! Now the priest's face shone with pleasure, and the crowd roared with delight when he picked the pears one by one until they were all gone, handing them round with a bow to each man present. Then the old man took the pick again, hacked at the tree until it fell with a crash, when he shouldered it, leaves and all, and with a final bow, walked away.All the time this had been going on, the countryman, quite forgetting his barrow and pears, had been in the midst of the crowd, standing on the tips of his toes, and straining his eyes to try to make out what was happening. But when the old priest had gone, and the crowd was getting thin, he turned round to his barrow, and saw with horror that it was quite empty. Every single pear had gone! In a moment he understood what had happened. The pears the old priest had been so generous in giving away were not his own; they were the countryman's! What was more, one of the handles of his barrow was missing, and there was no doubt that he had started from home with two! He was in a towering rage, and rushed as hard as he could after the priest; but just as he turned the corner he saw, lying close to the wall, the barrow-handle itself, which without any doubt was the very pear-tree which the priest had cut down. All the people in the market were simply splitting their sides with laughter; but as for the priest, no one saw him any more.​</h2><br />

Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

Janna's Experiment Janna noticed that there are crushed eggshells in the pots of orchids in her neighbor's garden. She wondered why eggshells are placed in the pots. She observed the orchid leaves in the garden and she saw that the leaves are dark green in color. She wants to find out if the eggshells affect the Bleen icon growth of the orchids in the garden. Janna guessed that orchids with eggshells will have greener leaves than those without eggshells because as the eggshells decompose, minerals in the shells and in the membrane will provide nutrients to the growing orchids. Greener leaves mean the orchids are healthy. Janna asked her father to help her prepare a greenhouse to conduct an experiment. They purchased 10 pots of orchids of the same variety, size and age. She arranged the 5 pots in the left corner of the greenhouse and another 5 pots in the right corner. Then, she made an initial record of the appearance of the orchids in her notebook. Together with her father, they collected some eggshells, crushed them, and distributed them equally among the 5 pots in the right corner. All the orchids were taken care of in the same way for 45 days. In the first and second week of observations, there were no manifestations of changes in the orchids but the succeeding observations started to show changes in the color of the orchid's leaves. After 45 days, Janna noticed that the leaves of the orchids with eggshells were darker green in color than those without eggshells. www Janna discovered that eggshells can be used as fertilizers for some varieties of orchids as shown by the greener color of their leaves. 2. Answer the given questions. 1. What are the initial observations in the situation? 2. Can you identify the real problem in the experiment? City of Good Character DISCIPLINE GOOD TASTE EXCELLENCE 3. What were the tentative explanations to the problem? 5 4. How did Janna find out if the explanations to the problem are correct? 5. Was there a fair testing in Janna's experiment? Explain. 6.

                            20. HOW THE WORLD BEGANA POPULAR BUKIDNON FOLKTALEA long, long time ago, when there was yet no world, there were three gods who lived in a small circular space of great brightness. Called a banting, and encircled by a rainbow, the space was just large enough for the two gods, Magbabaya and Dadanyahan, to sit across each other. The third god, the winged Makabughaw, sat precariously between the two, and had to flap his wings continuously to maintain his balance. Taking pity on Makabughaw, the one-headed Magbabaya (meaning your will be done) decided to build an extension so the poor Makabughaw could rest. To do this, he had to scoop soil from under the ten-headed Dadanyahan. He asked Makabughaw to do this for him. After studying the situation, Makabughaw swooped into Dadanyahans mouths and dived right through him so he could get soil from that point. He has the soil to Magbabaya who created earth from it.  But the earth was dry. How could it have turned lush and green? As Magbabaya puzzled over the problem, he happened to glance at Dadanyahans ten drooling mouths. Suddenly, he realized where he could get enough water to sprinkle over the earth. Dadanyahan agreed to the plan. Magbabaya blessed Dadanyahans saliva and the rain poured. Water washed over the earth. It shaped the mountains, hills, valleys, and plains; it made the streams, rivers and huge seas and oceans. Soon, vegetation began to sprout and grow. But this huge garden needed someone to take care of it. The two gods scooped some earth, and with the help from Dadanyahans saliva, turned it into sticky clay to form a figure. They collected wood for its bones, rattan from its blood vessels, and water for its blood. They molded seven figures in Magbabayas image. After the seventh figure was molded, Magbabaya had to leave to take care of a few other things. But before leaving, he told Dadanyahan not to tamper with the figures. Left alone with the figures, Dadanyahan could not help touching them up the way he thought they should look. Magbabaya returned to find Dadanyahan using his creative talents on the figures. This triggered a fight between them which Makabughaw tried to arbitrate in vain. The two gods dueled with each other until their metal weapons sank to the ground. These became the minerals that the human race later forged into its own weapons and mode of transport. Finally, the warring God reached an agreement. Because Dadanyahan had made the final form of the figures, he kept six figures while Magbabaya had only one since it was he who thought up the idea. Dadanyahans six figures became the various engkanto or guardians of the soil, water, and marine life, the plants, forests, and creatures of thej forest. Magbabayas lone figure became the first human being. The bits of clay cut from the figures as they were being modeled became the lower forms of animals. And thus did the world begin.Questions1.

He called his children to bid them farewell. All of them came but Bighari, the Goddess of Flowers.	Bathala, who valued promptness, became angry because this was not the first time that Bighari missed their gathering. Thus, he banished her from heavenly kingdom.	At that time, Bighari was at her garden on Earth. She wept bitterly when she was told of her banishment, but she sought to cope with her sorrow by causing her garden to bloom profusely.	The legend of the rainbow says that the people that used to live around her garden grew to love her more and more for bringing beauty to their lives. They resolved, after a time, to build her a bower so that they could see her garden even from a long distance. 	And so, they built it. And decked it all over with colorful blooms. Thereafter, whenever Bighari would travel, people would see her colorful bower against the sky.1. Who visited the Earth? __________________________2.
