                                            Directions: Read this passage about seahorses, Box the FACT and underline the OPINION Seahorses are the best animals in the world. They are in the genus (group of species) Hippocampus, which means "horse sea monster" in Ancient Greek. There are 47 species of seahorses. Only four species live in the Pacific Ocean next to North and South America. The dwarf seahorse lives in the Bahamas. Three kinds live in the Mediterranean Sea: the long-snouted seahorse, the short-snouted seahorse, and the sea pony. Even though they are slow, I think seahorses are amazing animals to watch. According to 2009 Guinness World Records, the dwarf seahorse is the slowest-moving fish, with a top speed of about 5 feet (150 cm) per hour. Seahorses range in size from a half inch to 14 inches. Seahorses should be protected from humans who want to capture them. It is bad when humans take them out of their habitat and try to sell them. I believe that seahorses are the most magical creatures in the ocean.​</a>

They are in the genus (group of species) Hippocampus, which means "horse sea monster" in Ancient Greek. There are 47 species of seahorses. Only four species live in the Pacific Ocean next to North and South America. The dwarf seahorse lives in the Bahamas. Three kinds live in the Mediterranean Sea: the long-snouted seahorse, the short-snouted seahorse, and the sea pony. Even though they are slow, I think seahorses are amazing animals to watch. According to 2009 Guinness World Records, the dwarf seahorse is the slowest-moving fish, with a top speed of about 5 feet (150 cm) per hour. Seahorses range in size from a half inch to 14 inches. Seahorses should be protected from humans who want to capture them. It is bad when humans take them out of their habitat and try to sell them. I believe that seahorses are the most magical creatures in the ocean.​</h2><br />
