The book became my new favorite and I don't think I will be able to love another book as much as I love this one... Questions: 1. Is her choice of words appropriate for a book review? Why or why not? 2. Point out 3 words that are inappropriate. Suggest a more appropriate alternative for each word. 3. What do you think should she do to improve her writing task?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>the review lacks specific examples or evidence to support her opinion, which may weaken her argument. It would have been more effective if she had provided concrete details about the characters and how they were portrayed in the book.<p></p>the 3 inappropriate words are:appalled" - a more appropriate alternative would be "disappointed" or "surprised.""heart-breaking" - a more appropriate alternative would be "devastating" or "tragic.""cried my heart out" - a more appropriate alternative would be "I was deeply moved" or "it brought tears to my eyes."<p></p>To improve her writing task, the student can add specific examples and evidence to support her opinion, as well as use a more formal tone and language appropriate for a book review. She can also provide more information about the book's plot, themes, and writing style to give readers a better idea of what the book is about and why she recommends it.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. While the reviewer's emotions are evident in her choice of words, some of the language used in the excerpt may not be appropriate for a book review. A book review is meant to provide an objective evaluation of a book's merits and demerits, and while personal feelings are an essential part of that evaluation, the language used should be measured and analytical rather than overly emotional.</p><p></p><p>2. The following are three words in the excerpt that may be considered inappropriate for a book review:</p><p>"appalled" - This word connotes a sense of shock and horror that may not be appropriate for a book review. A more appropriate alternative might be "surprised" or "taken aback."</p><p>"heart-breaking" - While this word does describe the reviewer's emotional response to the book, it is also overly dramatic and subjective. A more appropriate alternative might be "moving" or "touching."</p><p>"cried my heart out" - This phrase is overly colloquial and informal, and may not be appropriate for a formal writing task like a book review. A more appropriate alternative might be "was deeply moved" or "found myself emotional."</p><p></p><p>3. To improve her writing task, the reviewer should aim for a more measured and analytical tone in her language. She should strive to balance her personal emotional response to the book with a more objective evaluation of the book's merits and demerits. This could involve incorporating more specific examples from the book to support her evaluation and focusing on specific elements such as plot, characterization, and writing style. Additionally, she should aim to use more appropriate language for a formal writing task, avoiding overly colloquial or informal expressions.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Yes, her choice of words is appropriate for a book review. She expresses her emotional reaction to the book which is a key element of a book review. </p><p>2. Inappropriate words: Appalled, heart-breaking, cried my heart out. More appropriate alternatives: Disappointed, heartbreaking, sobbed. </p><p>3. She should provide more details on why she felt disappointed, heartbroken, and sobbed. She should explain why she loves the book so much and what makes it her new favorite. She should also provide more details on the plot and characters of the book.</p>1. The choice of words in the book review is not entirely appropriate. While it is important to express personal feelings and emotions when reviewing a book, the use of overly emotional language and hyperbole can detract from the analysis of the book's strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />2. Three inappropriate words in the book review are "appalled", "heart-breaking", and "cried my heart out". More appropriate alternatives could be "disappointed", "emotional", and "shed some tears".<br /><br />3. To improve her writing task, the student should focus on providing a more balanced analysis of the book, including its strengths and weaknesses. She should also aim to use more objective language and avoid excessive emotional language. Additionally, she could provide specific examples from the book to support her opinions and analysis.<br />
