The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</a>

                                            Favorite Place When Ana and her family go out for dinner, they always go to their favorite restaurant. Their favorite restaurant is Italian inspired. And they usually go once a week. Ana always gets pesto, and her little sister always gets carbonara. Their parents like to try different things. One week when they were getting ready to go out for dinner, Ana's father suggested to eat in a different restaurant. Ana and her sister Gaca groaned. The new restaurant was Filipino inspired. The two are not a fan of grilled food. "Let's try it once, and if you don't like it, we will go back to your tried and tested favorite restaurant next week." The two children got into the backseat of the car. When they arrived at the restaurant, a host met them at the door, greeted them and led them to a table and said, "Happy to serve, we hope that you will love what is on the menu tonight." The two The restaurant was very nice and their servers as well. The waiter came out with the food that they ordered children did not notice how big their smiles were when they saw the viands being served. There was kare-kare, fried chicken and pork barbeque. The family was full in no time. I think I have another favorite place to dine," said Ana. "Can we switch between the two restaurants for our weekly dinner?" asked Gaea. "That is a great idea." said Ana's mother. What type of restaurant was Ana's favorite? Why would Anna and Gaca have groaned about trying a new estaurant? What food did they order?​</a>

Text 1: Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation: conceived in liberty, dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war ... testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated ... can long endure. We are met on a gret battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

A Successful Fallure (by Glenn Frank) Several years ago, there appeared a series of papers that purported to be confessions of a succesful man who was under no delusion as to the essential quality of his attainments. The papers are not before me as I write, and I must trust to memory and a few penciled notes made at the time of their appearance, but it will be interesting to recall his confessions regarding his education. T think they paint a fairy faithful picture of the mind of the averge college graduate. He stated that he came from a family that prided itself on its culture and intellectuality and that had always been a family of professional folk. His grandfather was a clergyman; among his uncles were a lawyer, a physician and a professor, his sisters married professional men. He received a fairly good primry and secondary education, and was graduated from his university with honors. He was, he stated, of a distinctly literary turn of mind, and during his four years at college imblbed some slight information concerning the English classics as well as modern history and metaphysics, so that he could talk quite glibly about Chaucer, Beaumont and Fletcher, Thomas Love Peacock, and Ann Radcliffe, and speak with apparent familiarity about Kant and Schopenhauer.

I Have a Dream (by Martin Luther King, Jr.) I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Flve score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering Injustice.

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

10. MANILA, Philippines—San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped theTropang Giga’s perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20-7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. “This is a big game for us and I’m thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there,” said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to4-2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.

June 26 ,2020 Dear Cathy, Good Day! I am Stephen Cruz , a senior high school graduate . I wish to hear some words of advice from someone who is knowledgeable enough to help me get through with my worries. I graduated with good grades , enough to convince people that I did well in my studies. However, I well not be pursuing college yet because of financial incapacity . My parents cannot afford to send me to school this time as they do not have regular jobs. I understand them and I do not want to be a burden especially that I have four siblings and I am the eldest . To help me and the family's expenses, I plan to work in a BPO industry as a call center agent. This is also a way for me to save for my college studies. But I have a hard time with my English Grammar both in oral and written skills. Miss Cathy, is there a way to help improve my art in universal language? How can I be competent and proficient if I have poor pronunciation? I hope to hear your response soon. Sincerely, Stephen Cruz</a>

The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</h2><br />

It is usually impersonal and formal. </p><p>Examples: sermons, rhetorical statements and questions, speeches, pronouncements made by judges, announcements.</p><p></p>3.Consultative <p>It is formal and societal expectations accompany the users of this speech. • It is a professional discourse. </p><p>Examples: communication between a superior and a subordinate, doctor and patient, lawyer and client, lawyer and judge, teacher and student, counsellor and client.</p><p></p>4.Casual <p>This is an informal language used by peers and friends. Slang, vulgarities and colloquialism are normal. This is “group language.” One must be a member to engage in this register. </p><p>Examples: buddies, blogs, letters to friends</p><p></p>5.Intimate<p>This communication is private.

And they usually go once a week. Ana always gets pesto, and her little sister always gets carbonara. Their parents like to try different things. One week when they were getting ready to go out for dinner, Ana's father suggested to eat in a different restaurant. Ana and her sister Gaca groaned. The new restaurant was Filipino inspired. The two are not a fan of grilled food. "Let's try it once, and if you don't like it, we will go back to your tried and tested favorite restaurant next week." The two children got into the backseat of the car. When they arrived at the restaurant, a host met them at the door, greeted them and led them to a table and said, "Happy to serve, we hope that you will love what is on the menu tonight." The two The restaurant was very nice and their servers as well. The waiter came out with the food that they ordered children did not notice how big their smiles were when they saw the viands being served. There was kare-kare, fried chicken and pork barbeque.

Text 1: Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation: conceived in liberty, dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war ... testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated ... can long endure. We are met on a gret battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

A Successful Fallure (by Glenn Frank) Several years ago, there appeared a series of papers that purported to be confessions of a succesful man who was under no delusion as to the essential quality of his attainments. The papers are not before me as I write, and I must trust to memory and a few penciled notes made at the time of their appearance, but it will be interesting to recall his confessions regarding his education. T think they paint a fairy faithful picture of the mind of the averge college graduate. He stated that he came from a family that prided itself on its culture and intellectuality and that had always been a family of professional folk. His grandfather was a clergyman; among his uncles were a lawyer, a physician and a professor, his sisters married professional men. He received a fairly good primry and secondary education, and was graduated from his university with honors. He was, he stated, of a distinctly literary turn of mind, and during his four years at college imblbed some slight information concerning the English classics as well as modern history and metaphysics, so that he could talk quite glibly about Chaucer, Beaumont and Fletcher, Thomas Love Peacock, and Ann Radcliffe, and speak with apparent familiarity about Kant and Schopenhauer.

I Have a Dream (by Martin Luther King, Jr.) I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Flve score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering Injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity Source: https://www.americenchgtorls.com/spe nihaveadream.htm​</h2><br />

3. What is happiness? Happiness to me is not having everything but it is the state of being contented and satisfied with what one has. A girl who finds her old little doll a playmate and sister who completes her day is a happy child. But an old man who has a lot of wealth and has achieved much successes can remain unhappy if he feels he still lacks many things. He is such a pity.

8. Happiness is the state of being contented and satisfied with what you have. Have you ever asked yourself what simple joys you regularly have in your life? Here are some of the inexpensive pleasures that I indulge in to keep me sane in this beautiful but crazy world. I pray in quiet for ten minutes each morning. I pray for my family and friends that they may be able to surpass anything that may come their way each day. I make sure I have my “ME” time and read books as a form of relaxation. For me, happiness is not only for a millionaire. It is the ordinary things that we do that make our lives worth living. There are simple joys that I have which make my life like that of a millionaire.

The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped theTropang Giga’s perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20-7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. “This is a big game for us and I’m thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there,” said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to4-2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.

If you were Cathy , How would you respond to Stephen? What suggestions can you give that he must follow for him to improve? What must he do so he can pursue college? Write your response letter . June 26 ,2020 Dear Cathy, Good Day! I am Stephen Cruz , a senior high school graduate . I wish to hear some words of advice from someone who is knowledgeable enough to help me get through with my worries. I graduated with good grades , enough to convince people that I did well in my studies. However, I well not be pursuing college yet because of financial incapacity . My parents cannot afford to send me to school this time as they do not have regular jobs. I understand them and I do not want to be a burden especially that I have four siblings and I am the eldest . To help me and the family's expenses, I plan to work in a BPO industry as a call center agent. This is also a way for me to save for my college studies. But I have a hard time with my English Grammar both in oral and written skills. Miss Cathy, is there a way to help improve my art in universal language? How can I be competent and proficient if I have poor pronunciation? I hope to hear your response soon. Sincerely, Stephen Cruz</h2><br />
