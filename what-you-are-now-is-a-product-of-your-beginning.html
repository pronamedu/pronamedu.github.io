Research provides you with necessary information in your field of work, study or operation before youbegin working on it.2. The end result of such a research invokes a demand for change and sometimes is successful inproducing changes as well.3. A lot of what we do in our daily lives is not based on common sense, what we have learned from othersor what we have learned through personal experiences or observation.4. We all carry out research regularly, though we are aware that this is what we are doing.5. Only through research can new inventions and discoveries come into life,6. Research actually is the basic foundation for a successful endeavor.7. Scientific researchers are expected to set aside their personal biases, maintain objectivity, and aim foraccuracy and precision.8. In the social sciences, different methods have been developed for specific research purposes in itsbroad and varying fields.9. In quantitative research, the form of data is determined by the researcher in relation to the researchproblem.10. Today, online questionnaires aren't the most popular survey tools because it can't provide quick andtabulated results,11. Conclusions of qualitative researches are drawn from patterns and themes that emerge in the systemicanalysis of collected numerical data.12. Qualitative and quantitative researches are not mutually exclusive,13. Research has its specific norms and conventions, depending on the academic discipline under whichthe research is undertaken.14. Recent developments also show that the disciplines in these three branches of knowledge are no longerexclusive.15. Don't select a topic that you have a high degree of interest based on your curiosity about things orbased on your experiences.16. With your preliminary or working bibliography, you now have some idea of the available resourceswithin your reach.17. In narrowing down your topic, you might decide to employ a research design that would use amanageable amount of data to finish your research within a given time frame in a specific location.18. Like many of the products you buy, the research topic should be interesting to you and, if you canimagine, other people.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Local Biodiversity Conservation<p></p><strong>How has your community changed since the time you have lived there?</strong><p>Communities undergo constant change due to various factors such as population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and changes in lifestyle and culture. These changes can have both positive and negative impacts on local biodiversity. For example, urbanization can lead to the loss of natural habitats and fragmentation of ecosystems, while the adoption of eco-friendly practices can lead to the restoration and protection of biodiversity.</p><p></p><p>      2. <strong>What important issue is your community facing with regards to conservation and protection of local biodiversity? Why is the issue considered a problem or challenge in conserving the local biodiversity?</strong></p><p>Some common issues that communities face in conserving and protecting local biodiversity include habitat loss, invasive species, pollution, climate change, and overexploitation of natural resources. These issues can lead to the decline or extinction of species, loss of ecosystem services, and disruption of ecological processes. Addressing these issues can be a challenge due to the complexity of ecosystems and the need for cooperation and coordination among various stakeholders such as governments, communities, NGOs, and businesses. It is important to raise awareness, promote education, and implement effective strategies and policies to ensure the conservation and protection of local biodiversity for the present and future generations.</p><br />
