                                            Let's explore!Based on Mendel's experiment in genetic breeding, certain traits results from the pairing oftwo genes, one from the male parent and one from the female. We can use expressions tosummarize the possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, suppose a white gumamelaflower has a genotype WW, a red gumamela flower has a genotype RR, and a pink gumamelaflower has a genotype WR Each letter represents one of two genes that make up thecharacteristicsThe two bred flowers offspring can be expressed using an algebra model called a Punnetsquare.RRWRRPARENT #1WWWWRWR.PARENT #2The sum of the possible results for four offspring can be written as WW + WR + WR +RR; that is, one white, two pink and one red-gumamela flower.Suppose we substitute x for W and y for R. The result would be a sum of four monomials, xx + xy+ xy + yy, or x2 +2xy + y2. The two monomials xy and xy can be combined because they are liketerms. Like terms are two monomials that are the same or differ only by their numericalcoefficients.​</a>

We can use expressions tosummarize the possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, suppose a white gumamelaflower has a genotype WW, a red gumamela flower has a genotype RR, and a pink gumamelaflower has a genotype WR Each letter represents one of two genes that make up thecharacteristicsThe two bred flowers offspring can be expressed using an algebra model called a Punnetsquare.RRWRRPARENT #1WWWWRWR.PARENT #2The sum of the possible results for four offspring can be written as WW + WR + WR +RR; that is, one white, two pink and one red-gumamela flower.Suppose we substitute x for W and y for R. The result would be a sum of four monomials, xx + xy+ xy + yy, or x2 +2xy + y2. The two monomials xy and xy can be combined because they are liketerms.

<p>
</p><p>Here are the answers:
</p><strong>GYMNOSPERMS </strong>- These are the type of plants that bears cones instead of flowers or fruits. They are mostly trees, and are valuable sources of wood or timber. Most of these plants are old, and are known to have co-existed with the dinosaurs.
<strong>BRYOPHYTES </strong>- These plants are one of the simplest form of plants. The most common examples are the liverworts, hornworts, and mosses. You can see them growing on rocks, or on very cold environment.
