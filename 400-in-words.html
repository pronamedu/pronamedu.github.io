                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a senior high school student, I have been exposed to the daily struggles and challenges of commuting to school and around the city. The issue of traffic and transportation has been a hot topic for a long time, and it is easy to see why. The daily traffic congestion not only causes stress and inconvenience for commuters, but it also affects the economy and the environment.</p><p></p><p>One of the most prominent problems with traffic and transportation is the amount of time it takes to get from one place to another. Commuting to school alone takes me more than an hour, which is a waste of precious time that could have been spent studying or doing other productive activities. The same goes for other commuters who are trying to get to work, attend appointments, or run errands. The long hours spent in traffic only add to the stress and frustration of daily life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, traffic congestion also has a negative impact on the economy. The time and fuel wasted in traffic contribute to increased costs for businesses and individuals alike. The delay in delivery of goods and services can also lead to decreased productivity and profitability, which affects the overall growth of the economy.</p><p></p><p>The environment also suffers due to traffic. The emission of harmful gases from vehicles contributes to air pollution and has serious consequences for public health. The increased fuel consumption and traffic also lead to the depletion of natural resources, which affects the long-term sustainability of the environment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the issue of traffic and transportation is a complex and pressing matter that affects many aspects of our daily lives. It is imperative that the government and relevant stakeholders take concrete steps to address this problem, such as improving public transportation, constructing more efficient road networks, and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as biking or walking. Only by working together and taking action can we hope to overcome this challenge and improve the quality of life for everyone.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Foot binding, also known as "lotus feet," was a traditional practice in ancient China where young girls had their feet tightly bound to prevent them from growing properly. This practice was prevalent in China for over a thousand years and was considered a symbol of beauty and wealth despite being painful and harmful.</p><p></p><p>The process of foot binding typically began when a girl was around five or six years old. The feet were soaked in hot water to soften them, and then the toes were curled under and held in place with bandages. Over time, the bandages were tightened, and the feet were forced to become smaller and smaller. The process was extremely painful, and many girls suffered from infections and other foot-related health problems as a result.</p><p></p><p>Foot binding was a symbol of beauty and status in ancient China because it was believed that small feet were more attractive and feminine. Women with small feet were considered more desirable and were more likely to marry into wealthy families. Thus, foot binding became a way for families to improve their social status and ensure their daughters' future success.</p><p></p><p>However, foot binding was not just a symbol of beauty and status; it was also a way to control women's behavior. Women with bound feet were less mobile and less able to work outside the home, which made it easier for men to control their movements and keep them in the domestic sphere. Foot binding was thus considered a way to create obedient and submissive wives.</p><p></p><p>Despite its harmful effects, foot binding continued for over a thousand years in China, until it was finally banned in the early 20th century. The ban was part of a wider effort to modernize China and eliminate harmful traditional practices. Today, foot binding is no longer practiced in China, but the legacy of this harmful practice lives on. Many elderly women in China still suffer from the consequences of foot binding, including chronic pain and disability.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, foot binding was a harmful practice that persisted in China for over a thousand years. It was a symbol of beauty and status, but it was also a way to control women's behavior and keep them in the domestic sphere. Today, foot binding is no longer practiced in China, but its legacy continues to affect many elderly women who suffered from this painful and damaging practice. It serves as a reminder of the harmful effects of traditional practices that prioritize beauty and status over health and well-being.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan po 400 words</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The 20th century was the beginning of many social changes across the globe and several worldwide war conflicts that affected both Western and non-Western countries. Many of these are continuing to affect the world in the current 21st century as well. While it was a relatively short time compared to the rest of human history, its effect cannot be underestimated in terms of importance.World War I was the most prominent global conflict in the world at the time, and it tied both Western and non-Western nations as it had never happened before. While the conflict took less than a decade to conclude, its effects shattered people’s perception of the world. For the first time in history, countries that came out as victors in the war were restricted from taking over defeated lands. The newly established mandate system declared that annexation was never Allied Forces’ intention (Roberts and David 141). An anti-imperialist trend was growing in the 20th century, which coincided with a rise of colonial nationalism at the same time.The dissatisfaction of working and other marginalized social classes led to a growing demand for social and cultural changes across the globe, but especially in Russian Empire, British and French colonies, and the US (Glenda and Patricia 211). The United States became one of the most influential countries globally to the point that when the American stock market experienced the Great Crash, it affected the rest of the world, leading to the Great Depression (Roberts and David 180).</p><p></p><p>When the USSR became a major powerhouse, the US was the nation that opposed it the most, leading to the long-lasting Cold War. While USSR eventually fell apart, the post-Soviet countries are still affected by its history. The shift from the 20th to the 21st century was when globalization grew as a global trend thanks to the booming Internet culture and technological advancements that allow people to interact regardless of distances or political and cultural differences.</p><p></p><p>The 20th century can be considered an overall time of social and political change across the globe as it was rife with conflicts, changes, and advancements. Western and non-Western worlds alike took part in the global conflicts and developed closer relations, although often for the latter’s detriment. Even though a new century and new millennia began in 2000, the effects of previous decades still affect cultures, politics, and economies across the globe to this day.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            18. 400 word essay about poverty​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Poverty is the worst form of violence”. – Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p></p><p>We can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.</p><p></p><p>How Poverty is Measured?</p><p></p><p>For measuring poverty United nations have devised two measures of poverty – Absolute &amp; relative poverty.  Absolute poverty is used to measure poverty in developing countries like India. Relative poverty is used to measure poverty in developed countries like the USA. In absolute poverty, a line based on the minimum level of income has been created &amp; is called a poverty line.  If per day income of a family is below this level, then it is poor or below the poverty line. If per day income of a family is above this level, then it is non-poor or above the poverty line. In India, the new poverty line is  Rs 32 in rural areas and Rs 47 in urban areas.</p><p></p><p>Causes of Poverty</p><p></p><p>According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.</p><p></p><p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.</p><p></p><p>In some countries, especially African countries like Somalia, a long period of civil war has made poverty widespread. This is because all the resources &amp; money is being spent in war instead of public welfare. Countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. are prone to natural disasters like cyclone, etc. These disasters occur every year causing poverty to rise.</p><p></p><p>Ill Effects of Poverty</p><p></p><p>Poverty affects the life of a poor family. A poor person is not able to take proper food &amp; nutrition &amp;his capacity to work reduces. Reduced capacity to work further reduces his income, making him poorer. Children from poor family never get proper schooling &amp; proper nutrition. They have to work to support their family &amp; this destroys their childhood. Some of them may also involve in crimes like theft, murder, robbery, etc. A poor person remains uneducated &amp; is forced to live under unhygienic conditions in slums. There are no proper sanitation &amp; drinking water facility in slums &amp; he falls ill often &amp;  his health deteriorates. A poor person generally dies an early death. So, all social evils are related to poverty.</p><p></p><p>Government Schemes to Remove Poverty</p><p></p><p>The government of India also took several measures to eradicate poverty from India. Some of them are – creating employment opportunities, controlling population, etc. In India, about 60% of the population is still dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. Government has taken certain measures to promote agriculture in India. The government constructed certain dams &amp; canals in our country to provide easy availability of water for irrigation. Government has also taken steps for the cheap availability of seeds &amp; farming equipment to promote agriculture. Government is also promoting farming of cash crops like cotton, instead of food crops. In cities, the government is promoting industrialization to create more jobs. Government has also opened  ‘Ration shops’. Other measures include providing free &amp; compulsory education for children up to 14 years of age, scholarship to deserving students from a poor background, providing subsidized houses to poor people, etc.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is a social evil, we can also contribute to control it. For example- we can simply donate old clothes to poor people, we can also sponsor the education of a poor child or we can utilize our free time by teaching poor students. Remember before wasting food, somebody is still sleeping hungry.</p><p></p><br />

Effective communication provides a foundation for trust and respect to grow. It also helps better understand a person and the context of the conversation. Individuals often believe that their communication skills are much better than what they actually are.Communication appears effortless; however, much of what two people discuss gets misunderstood, thus leading to conflicts and distress. To communicate effectively, one must understand the emotion behind the information being said.

An effective listener is one who, not only comprehends how the speaker feels but, also understands what they are stating. Building a strong connection between the speaker and the listener is one of the first steps to become a good listener. By building this connection speakers should first be in an environment with open minded listeners, it makes them feel more comfortable to state their opinions, feelings and ideas. Listeners should avoid being judgmental. The individual does not have to agree with the ideas, values or opinions of the speaker; however, to fully understand them, one must put aside their criticism.

This can inform individuals to better understand the use of body language when conversing with other people. It is also important to take into account individual differences. Different cultures use different non-verbal gestures. Frequently, when observing these gestures alone the observer can get the wrong impression, for instance, the listener can subconsciously cross their arms. This does not mean that they are bored or annoyed with the speaker; it can be a gesture that they are comfortable with. Viewing gestures as a whole will prevent these misunderstandings. Non-verbal gestures are not only physical, for example; the tone of voice addressing a child will be different from the way it is addressed to an adult.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>di ko na yan binilang kayo na bahala</p><br />
