                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic :Beauty </p><p>The subjective element of beauty involves judgment, not opinion. Many people feel beauty is only something seen by the eyes. St. Thomas Aquinas views beauty in both the supernatural and natural orders. Aquinas lists the attributes of beauty to be found in nature. These are; unity, proportion, and clarity. We will see how these attributes of beauty are seen through the eye and felt by the heart. To begin, the concept of unity follows the Aristotelian proposition that nothing can be added to or taken away from a perfect work of art. Next, proportion, or the harmony of the parts to the whole and to each other is, based the mathematical and geometric relationships discovered by the Ancient Greeks. Beauty is something that can be interpreted completely different from person to person. A famous quote that goes along with this perfectly is “beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” I think a person’s inner beauty should be taken into account when deciding whether or not a person is beautiful.</p><p></p><br />
