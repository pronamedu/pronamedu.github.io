What is required to set an object into motion? b. If you exert more force in creating periodic waves by tapping the surface with greater strength, how does this affect the movement of the paper boat? 3. Sketch the water waves as seen them from above the basin. One wavelength should be labeled in the drawing 4. Tap the water rapidly to increase the rate of the vibration. What happens to the wavelength of the waves? Sketch the water waves as seen from the top of the basin. 5. Discuss the steps in determining the speed of a wave.

                                            C. What are surface waves? Place a basin filled with water on top of a level table. Wait until the water becomes still or motionless. Create a wave pulse by tapping the surface of the water with your index finger and observe the direction of travel of the wave pulse. Tap the surface of the water at regular intervals to create periodic waves. View the waves from above and draw the pattern that you see in the box. In your drawing, mark the source of the disturbance. 1. 2. 3. ( Wait for the water to become still before you place your paper boat on the surface. Create periodic waves and observe what happens to your paper boat. Q8. Do the waves set the paper boat into motion? What is required to set an object into motion? Q9. If you exert more energy in creating periodic waves by tapping the surface with greater strength, how does this affect the movement of the paper boat? If you were somehow able to mark individual water molecules (you used a colored ribbon to do this earlier) and follow them as waves pass by, you would find that their paths are like those shown in Figure 5. Wave direction 9000 Trough Crest 200000 Water molecules move in circular orbits when waves pass by Figure 5. Surface waves Q10. As shown in the figure, the passage of a wave across a surface of a body of water involves the motion of particles following a pattern about their original positions. Q11. Does the wave transport water molecules from the source of the vibration? Support your answer using the shown figure.​</a>

Speed and velocity are the same but differ with direction of the motion. 27. When the graph shows downward slope, it is accelerating. 28. The upward and downward motion of the rope moving away from the source represents the transverse wave. 29. In longitudinal wave, the direction of the wave is straight to the direction of the source. 30. In the activity on paper boat, it requires energy to set an object into motion, 31. Vibration is the source of the wave pulse. 32. A periodic wave cannot be regarded as a series of pulses. 33. The wave carries more energy causing the paper boat to vibrate strongly and create motion 34. The forward and backward motion of the coil spring during the activity represents the longitudinal wave. 35. When plotting the time and position in a graph, time is plotted on the y-axis and position on the x-axis​</a>

                        <p>Let me answer these two questions separately.
</p><p><strong>Do the waves set the paper boat into motion?
</strong></p><p>The answer to this question is YES.
</p><p>Explanation:
</p><p>According to the first law of motion, an object will remain at rest or in motion unless there is an external unbalanced force that acts upon the object. This first law of motion is also called the law of inertia.
</p><p>If we were going to analyze the situation, the waves of the water are exerting a force into the boat. Since there is an, external force that acts upon the boat, therefore the boat will move thus settings the paper boat into motion.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>What is required to set an object into motion?
</strong></p><p>To set an object into motion, it will require an external unbalance force.
</p><p>Explanation:
</p><p>This is still according to the first law of motion. We can say that the force that will act upon the object should be external. This means that it will come from another object. The term unbalanced force means that the force that acts upon the object should not equal to the force that the object is exerting.  </p><p>Let us have an example.
</p><p>Object A has a force of 10N and object B has a force of 20N. When the two objects collide, object A will move since the force of object B is greater than the force of object A. This is what we called unbalanced force.  </p><p>However, If object A has a force of 10 N and object B had a force of also 10N neither of the two will move since they will cancel out each others force. Since the force is balanced.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Surface waves are a type of wave that propagates along the interface between two media, such as the surface of a body of water and the air above it. They are often caused by disturbances such as wind or seismic activity.</p><p></p><p>To create a wave pulse on the surface of water in a basin, you can tap the surface with your index finger, which will create a circular disturbance that will propagate outwards. If you tap the surface at regular intervals, you can create periodic waves with a specific wavelength and frequency.</p><p></p><p>When you observe the waves from above, you will see a pattern of crests and troughs that move in a specific direction away from the source of the disturbance. The source of the disturbance is marked by the location where you tap the surface of the water.</p><p></p><p>If you place a paper boat on the surface of the water and create periodic waves, you will observe that the waves do set the boat into motion. This is because the boat is floating on the surface of the water, which is itself being moved by the waves. To set an object into motion, a force must be applied to it, such as the force of the waves on the paper boat.</p><p></p><p>If you exert more energy in creating periodic waves by tapping the surface with greater strength, the movement of the paper boat will be more pronounced. This is because the waves will have a larger amplitude and a greater energy, which will transfer more force to the boat.</p><p></p><p>The figure shown illustrates how the passage of a wave across the surface of a body of water involves the motion of particles following a circular pattern about their original positions. As the wave passes by, the water molecules move in a circular orbit, but they do not transport water molecules from the source of the vibration. The water molecules return to their original positions after the wave has passed, and only the energy of the wave is transported from the source to the surrounding area.</p><p></p><br />

                            15. How does the boat's motion relate to the direction the water waves travel?​</h2><br />
                        <p>The motion of a boat is related to the direction the water waves travel in several ways. The most obvious way is that the motion of the boat is affected by the water waves, which means that the boat may rise and fall as it moves over the waves. This is because the waves create an up-and-down motion in the water, which is then transferred to the boat.</p><p></p><p>Another way that the boat's motion is related to the direction the water waves travel is through the concept of wave direction. If the waves are traveling in the same direction as the boat, then the boat will experience a smoother ride because it will be moving along with the waves. However, if the waves are traveling perpendicular or at an angle to the boat, then the boat will experience a more turbulent ride because it will be moving against the waves.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the direction of the water waves has a significant impact on the motion of a boat. The boat's motion is affected by the up-and-down motion of the waves, as well as the direction in which the waves are traveling. Skilled boat operators can use this knowledge to navigate more efficiently and avoid rough water conditions.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnlearning</p><br />

                        Yes, the waves is also a reason how a paper boat can be set into motion. But even the wind can affect it :)<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In sound waves, energy is transferred through vibration of air particles or particles of a solid through which the sound travels. In water waves, energy is transferred through the vibration of the water particles.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Mark me in br@inlest po ty </p>What is transferred by waves in the water/paper boat?<p></p><p>In water waves, energy is transferred through the vibration of the water particles. Waves transfer energy but not mass. Buoys like this DART® tsunami buoy are moved up and down by the waves that pass by them but don’t move directionally across the water.</p><p></p>Does a boat wave when it moves through the water?<p>It must produce some sort of wave if it is ‘moving through the water’. However if it is moving stern first then it will produce a stern wave - not a bow wave. But actually it is not as simple as that because a boat moving through the water bow first will also create a bow wave or what is often known as a wake.</p><p></p><p><strong>Pa brainliest po ✨</strong></p><br />

Speed and velocity are the same but differ with direction of the motion. 27. When the graph shows downward slope, it is accelerating. 28. The upward and downward motion of the rope moving away from the source represents the transverse wave. 29. In longitudinal wave, the direction of the wave is straight to the direction of the source. 30. In the activity on paper boat, it requires energy to set an object into motion, 31. Vibration is the source of the wave pulse. 32. A periodic wave cannot be regarded as a series of pulses. 33. The wave carries more energy causing the paper boat to vibrate strongly and create motion 34. The forward and backward motion of the coil spring during the activity represents the longitudinal wave. 35. When plotting the time and position in a graph, time is plotted on the y-axis and position on the x-axis​</h2><br />
