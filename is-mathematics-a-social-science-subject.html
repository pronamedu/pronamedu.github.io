SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATORY PROCESSLesson 1.1-PURE AND APPLIED SCIENCEWhat is Science?Science may be broadly defined as development and systematization of positive knowledge about thephysical world.What is Pure Science?a science depending on deductions from demonstrated truths, such as mathematics oriogic, or studied without regard to practical applications.It is the search for facts.Examples of Pure Science Scientist study human vision to learn how the eyes works.Students look through a microscope to see what's inside the cell.A biologist is experimenting on plant's reaction to lack of sunlight.What is applied Science? The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane? Explain your answer.________________________WORKSHEET NO.2DIRECTIONS: Classify whether the following professions/occupations are related to physical er biologicalscience.1. Doctor2. Engineer3.

The research field is comprised of students enrolled in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th years of Business Administration,
Economics, and Finance departments of Faculties of Economics and Administrative Sciences of state universities in
Turkey in the 2003-2004 Academic Year Fall Term. As it would be time consuming and unfeasible to contact and
Include all students currently attending social sciences branches of 50 active state universities in the related period,
each of these state universities located in seven different geographical regions has been accepted a stratum.
Considering that mathematics anxiety and attitude level of students from 9 state universities may vary according to
their departments, a gradual sampling method depending on strata was performed by attaching a sub stratum to each
department. The volume of sampling was determined so as to include 1620 persons comprising of 15 students from
1, 2, 3, and 4th years of each department. However, 1440 students out of 1620 have been reached.

The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on. For you as a student is technology a boon or a bane?

</p><p>A. Introduction
</p><p>Panimula Day 1
</p><p> May dalawang sistema ng pagsusukat , ito ay ang sistemang Ingles at 
</p><p>sistemang Metrik. Ang bawat sistema ay may iba’t ibang yunit na ginagamit. 
</p><p>Bawat yunit ng sistemang Ingles ay may katumbas na sukat sa sistemang Metrik. 
</p><p>Sa araling ito, ikaw ay inaasahang: (a) nakikilala ang dalawang pamamaraan ng 
</p><p>pagsukat; (b) nagagamit ang dalawang pamamaraan ng pagsusukat sa mga 
</p><p>gawaing pang-industriya; (c) napapahalagahan ang tamang paggamit ng 
</p><p>dalawang pamamaraan ng pagsusukat.
</p><p> Ang dalawang Sistema ng pagsusukat at pamamaraan nito ay mahalaga 
</p><p>upang may batayan sa pagkuha ng sukat at ang yunit na ginagamit lalo na kung 
</p><p>ito ay may kaukulang bayad, mahalaga din ang angkop matutunan ang 
</p><p>dalawang uri ng pagsusukat lalo na sa gawaing pang industriyal tulad ng 
</p><p>paggawa ng mga gamit sa bahay, pagplano ng pagtatayo ng gusali, paguhit, 
</p><p>atbp. Halimbawa ay sa pagbili ng kahoy sa hardware, anong uri naman kaya ng 
</p><p>pagsusukat ang ginagamit ng tindera upang malaman ang babayaran ng 
</p><p>mamimili? 
</p><p>Pag-aralan ang dalawang pamamaraan sa pagsusukat.
</p><p>Sistemang Ingles
</p><p> 12 pulgada = 1 piye o talampakan
</p><p> 3 piye = 1 yarda
</p><p>Sistemang Metrik

                            23. IV. Identify the subject, sample, population and the sampling technique used in the study. (10 points)
The research field is comprised of students enrolled in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th years of Business Administration,
Economics, and Finance departments of Faculties of Economics and Administrative Sciences of state universities in
Turkey in the 2003-2004 Academic Year Fall Term. As it would be time consuming and unfeasible to contact and
Include all students currently attending social sciences branches of 50 active state universities in the related period,
each of these state universities located in seven different geographical regions has been accepted a stratum.
Considering that mathematics anxiety and attitude level of students from 9 state universities may vary according to
their departments, a gradual sampling method depending on strata was performed by attaching a sub stratum to each
department. The volume of sampling was determined so as to include 1620 persons comprising of 15 students from
1, 2, 3, and 4th years of each department. However, 1440 students out of 1620 have been reached.
