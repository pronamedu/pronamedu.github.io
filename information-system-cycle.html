Reproductive System and Fertility
Cellular division is an essential part of the cell cycle. When a cell divides it passes genetic information to daughter cells. The amount of genetic information passed onto daughter cells depends on whether the cell undergoes mitosis or meiosis. Mitosis is the most common form of cell division. All somatic cells undergo mitosis, whereas only germ cells undergo meiosis. Meiosis is very important because it produces gametes (sperm and eggs) that are required for sexual reproduction. Human germ cells have 46 chromosomes (2n = 46) and undergo meiosis to produce four haploid daughter cells (gametes).
1. The birth of Louise Brown in 1978, the world’s first test-tube baby, sparked a wave of moral outrage from the public. Today, in-vitro fertilization and “cryogenics” are one of the most common solutions for couples with fertility issues. Are you in favor of it? Why or why not? Cite practical implications of taking this method. (9points)</a>

                                            ains Some very important tasks you do in school either face-to-face or distance learning requires writing compositions and presenting oral and written reports. In today's lesson, you will learn to organize information from secondary sources in preparation for writing. reporting and similar academic tasks in collaboration with others. A secondary source is a document or recording that gives information from a primary source. The original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Some examples are reference materials, nonfiction books, biographies, nonprint materials, almanacs, atlases and gazetteers, specialized references, CD-ROM references. periodicals, encyclopedias, video references and electronic databases. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. Using primary source or secondary source helps you gather information. On the other hand, organizing information needs thorough reading, gathering information, validating the facts, and writing comprehensively. You may use the following ideas in organizing information from the secondary sources: Location-you can organize information by showing visual depiction of a physical space. You may use diagrams, analogues, graphic representations and maps to organize location. For example: Parts of the nervous system that may be presented using a diagram. Alphabet-some information is easy to organize using specific terms in alphabetical order like in dictionaries and index (at the back of a textbook). Time-another important factor in organizing information is the time element like history of humanity or events happened in a person's life journey. You may use fish bone, timeline, steps and cycle graphic organizers. Category-the use of category in presenting information is different from time. This type is used to group similar characteristics such as color, size, usage, brand, texture, materials, gender, age, model, price, content and nature. For example: Types of vehicles that may be written and presented according to usage, brand name, model and price, Hierarchy-hierarchies are used to indicate the ranks as to heaviest to lightest, smallest to biggest. For example: Rank of population in Lucena City. This is showing how one piece of information is connected to another broader information that you like to emphasize in your written and oral reports Answer the following questions: 1. What are the secondary sources of information? 2. What different ideas can you use in organizing information from secondary sources? 3.

                                            1. Input This is the first event in the cycle. This stage involves collection of data from the outside or also from within the system. It is the collection of raw data from the outside world so it can be put into an information system. This means putting the acquired data into the information system. Examples: a. The payroll clerk collects workers' timecards so he knows how many hours each person worked that week and types the hours from the timecards into a spreadsheet using MS Excel. b. Conducting a survey of customers' opinions on a new product and then scanning the survey cards with a card reader. c. Collecting quotes for a quote book and typing quotes into a word processor like MS Word. f. Using a form on an insurance website to collect visitors' opinions. Keyboards, mice, flatbed scanners, bar code readers, joysticks, digital data tablets (for) graphic drawing), electronic cash registers and others are some of the typical input devices. 2. Processing In this stage the computer processes the tiniest details entered. This processing makes the data entered usable. This is the interpretation of data input in the computer system through a processor commonly known as the Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU as the processor is the key component in a digital computer capable of executing a program. It interprets computer programs instructions and processes data. CPUs provide the fundamental digital computer trait of programmability, and are one of the necessary components found in computers of any era, along with memory and input/output facilities. A CPU that is manufactured as a single integrated circuit is usually known as a microprocessor. Beginning in the mid-1970s, microprocessors of ever-increasing complexity and power gradually supplanted other designs, and today the term "CPU" is usually applied to some type of microprocessor. More of this will be discussed further when you reach the topic on Parts of a Computer. Typical processing software includes: a.Word Processors b. Spreadsheet c. Payroll Systems d. Web Browsers​</a>

Reproductive System and Fertility
Cellular division is an essential part of the cell cycle. When a cell divides it passes genetic information to daughter cells. The amount of genetic information passed onto daughter cells depends on whether the cell undergoes mitosis or meiosis. Mitosis is the most common form of cell division. All somatic cells undergo mitosis, whereas only germ cells undergo meiosis. Meiosis is very important because it produces gametes (sperm and eggs) that are required for sexual reproduction. Human germ cells have 46 chromosomes (2n = 46) and undergo meiosis to produce four haploid daughter cells (gametes).

                            16. ains Some very important tasks you do in school either face-to-face or distance learning requires writing compositions and presenting oral and written reports. In today's lesson, you will learn to organize information from secondary sources in preparation for writing. reporting and similar academic tasks in collaboration with others. A secondary source is a document or recording that gives information from a primary source. The original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Some examples are reference materials, nonfiction books, biographies, nonprint materials, almanacs, atlases and gazetteers, specialized references, CD-ROM references. periodicals, encyclopedias, video references and electronic databases. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. Using primary source or secondary source helps you gather information. On the other hand, organizing information needs thorough reading, gathering information, validating the facts, and writing comprehensively. You may use the following ideas in organizing information from the secondary sources: Location-you can organize information by showing visual depiction of a physical space. You may use diagrams, analogues, graphic representations and maps to organize location. For example: Parts of the nervous system that may be presented using a diagram. Alphabet-some information is easy to organize using specific terms in alphabetical order like in dictionaries and index (at the back of a textbook). Time-another important factor in organizing information is the time element like history of humanity or events happened in a person's life journey. You may use fish bone, timeline, steps and cycle graphic organizers. Category-the use of category in presenting information is different from time. This type is used to group similar characteristics such as color, size, usage, brand, texture, materials, gender, age, model, price, content and nature. For example: Types of vehicles that may be written and presented according to usage, brand name, model and price, Hierarchy-hierarchies are used to indicate the ranks as to heaviest to lightest, smallest to biggest. For example: Rank of population in Lucena City. This is showing how one piece of information is connected to another broader information that you like to emphasize in your written and oral reports Answer the following questions: 1. What are the secondary sources of information? 2. What different ideas can you use in organizing information from secondary sources? 3. How are these ideas helpful in organizing information? mustions that​</h2><br />

seminar to couples who are about to get married. The objective of the seminar is to inform couples about the
reproductive system, the process of fertilization, and the normal menstrual cycle to help them in planning for their
family. You are to prepare a written report for your seminar. Your written presentation will be evaluated based on
the following criteria.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Achieving good reproductive health remains a far-off goal in many parts of the world. This lack of care has repercussions. An estimated 830 women die of pregnancy-related causes each day, amounting to more than 300,000 deaths each year; 99% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.(1) However, access to family planning can greatly reduce these mortality rates. One 2012 study found that contraceptive use caused a 44% reduction in maternal mortality in 2008; these researchers also predicted that providing access to contraception for all those who need it would reduce worldwide maternal deaths by 29%.(2) These statistics call for increased access to reproductive health and family planning services.</p><br />

                            22. 1. Input This is the first event in the cycle. This stage involves collection of data from the outside or also from within the system. It is the collection of raw data from the outside world so it can be put into an information system. This means putting the acquired data into the information system. Examples: a. The payroll clerk collects workers' timecards so he knows how many hours each person worked that week and types the hours from the timecards into a spreadsheet using MS Excel. b. Conducting a survey of customers' opinions on a new product and then scanning the survey cards with a card reader. c. Collecting quotes for a quote book and typing quotes into a word processor like MS Word. f. Using a form on an insurance website to collect visitors' opinions. Keyboards, mice, flatbed scanners, bar code readers, joysticks, digital data tablets (for) graphic drawing), electronic cash registers and others are some of the typical input devices. 2. Processing In this stage the computer processes the tiniest details entered. This processing makes the data entered usable. This is the interpretation of data input in the computer system through a processor commonly known as the Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU as the processor is the key component in a digital computer capable of executing a program. It interprets computer programs instructions and processes data. CPUs provide the fundamental digital computer trait of programmability, and are one of the necessary components found in computers of any era, along with memory and input/output facilities. A CPU that is manufactured as a single integrated circuit is usually known as a microprocessor. Beginning in the mid-1970s, microprocessors of ever-increasing complexity and power gradually supplanted other designs, and today the term "CPU" is usually applied to some type of microprocessor. More of this will be discussed further when you reach the topic on Parts of a Computer. Typical processing software includes: a.Word Processors b. Spreadsheet c. Payroll Systems d.
