I think during the emergence period, authors are also able to express their thoughts and ideas that they observeabout the society4. According to Jose M. Hemandez, Philippine Literature during the Emergence period is the perfect time for the writersto discover their forte in writing,5. I believe that period of emergence is also known for author's rapid growth.6.In the article I have read, in 1935-1945 three group of writers emerged, those who are concerned with socialconsciousness, craftsmanship, and those who explore local color.7. In my opinion, these group of writers emerged were able to help Filipino people during this period.8.In 1937 the Philippine Book guild was founded. Its purpose was to produce literature and create a reading in public,9. In 1939, the Philippine Writer's Guild was established. The creed of members was to develop a common culturalconsciousness among Filipinos.10. I think Philippine Book Guild that was established in 1937 became the way to educate many Filipino people in termsof social consciousness, craftsmanship and be aware of local colours.pls answer it​</a>

I think during the emergence period, authors are also able to express their thoughts and ideas that they observeabout the society4. According to Jose M. Hemandez, Philippine Literature during the Emergence period is the perfect time for the writersto discover their forte in writing,5. I believe that period of emergence is also known for author's rapid growth.6.In the article I have read, in 1935-1945 three group of writers emerged, those who are concerned with socialconsciousness, craftsmanship, and those who explore local color.7. In my opinion, these group of writers emerged were able to help Filipino people during this period.8.In 1937 the Philippine Book guild was founded. Its purpose was to produce literature and create a reading in public,9. In 1939, the Philippine Writer's Guild was established. The creed of members was to develop a common culturalconsciousness among Filipinos.10. I think Philippine Book Guild that was established in 1937 became the way to educate many Filipino people in termsof social consciousness, craftsmanship and be aware of local colours.pls answer it​</h2><br />
