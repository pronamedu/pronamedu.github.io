He felt his hand tremble. He tried to speak but gave up as his mouth was dry and his tongue felt swollen. He gulped and stretched out around her shoulder. This was not very subtle and she smirked. He broke into a sweat. It was not going well, so he took his arm back again. He still had not kissed a girl. Summary:​</a>

The prince was mean and rude towards the people of his kingdom. He mocked and made fun of all the girls that he saw along his way. One day a visitor arrived in the kingdom. It was an old ugly woman. When he saw the visitor the prince laughed so hard and mocked the old woman. The old woman got angry and pointed her finger at the prince and cast a spell. "I will turn you into an ugly black rabbit for being such a mean and bad mannered person. Poof! the prince instantly turned into a black rabbit. "Only when someone takes pity and sheds a tear for you will the spell be broken." On the other side of the kingdom there was a river and on its riverbank was the house of a beautiful girl named Felicia. She was a beautiful and kindhearted girl. Every morning Felicia would go to the river to wash their clothes. One day as she washed their clothes, she saw a black dirty rabbit. She picked up the rabbit and bathed it in the water. She felt pity for the poor rabbit so, she decided to bring the rabbit to her house. As she walked towards home she met an old woman. When the old woman saw the rabbit she claimed that the rabbit was hers. She asked Felicia to give her the rabbit. But the rabbit cried and held on tightly to Felicia's arms. The old woman got angry and turned herself into an evil witch. "Give me my Rabbit! I am Its master!" But Felicia was not afraid of the witch. She did not let go the rabbit. Instead she fought the witch with all her might. As Felicia and the witch were fighting, they didn't notice that the rabbit fell into the water. Felicia did not hesitate to swim into the water and save the drowning rabbit.. Oh my poor, dear rabbit please wake up", she said as she hugged the dying rabbit. She was crying so hard that her tears fell onto the rabbit's body. Suddenly the rabbit turned into a handsome prince. The prince thanked her for saving his life.

                                            Box Full of Kisses Some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, "This is for you, Daddy." The man became embarrassed by his over-reaction earlier, but his rage continued when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her, "Don't you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They're all for you, Daddy." The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. Her father kept the gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there (https wealthygon llaco 10-most-inspirational-short-sorus) Moral of the story: Love is the most precious gift in the world.

                                            Father’s LoveUnknown	One day a 12 years old girlasked her Father, “What is your gift for my next birthday? “Father smiled and said, “There is much time, so wait till your birthday my love.” Just after few days of this conversation, the girl fainted and was rushed to the Hospital. After checking on the girl, the Doctor came out and informed the family that the girl had a Bad Heart and probably will die. Everyone in the family was shocked after hearing the news and didn’t know what to do. While the girl was lying on the bed and her father was sitting near to her, the girl asked, “Daddy, am I going to die?” father replied, “No dear, you will live.” The father gave her warm hug and kissed her on her forehead and left weeping. The girl said, “How can you be so sure daddy?” Father turned around and replied, “I know” and smile.After some time the girl got treated and was recovering, at same time she turned 13. After she came home, she found a letter on her bed.	My Sweet Kid, if you are reading this, it means everything went well as I told you. Do you remember? Once you asked me what gift I will give for your Birthday. Well, at that time I did not know what I am going to give you, but now my Present to you is MY HEART”.	
 question: If you are a friend of that girl who’s father sacrifices himself, how can you help ease the       pain to prevent depression?​</a>

When he saw the visitor the prince laughed so hard and mocked the old woman. The old woman got angry and pointed her finger at the prince and cast a spell. "I will turn you into an ugly black rabbit for being such a mean and bad mannered person. Poof! the prince instantly turned into a black rabbit. "Only when someone takes pity and sheds a tear for you will the spell be broken." On the other side of the kingdom there was a river and on its riverbank was the house of a beautiful girl named Felicia. She was a beautiful and kindhearted girl. Every morning Felicia would go to the river to wash their clothes. One day as she washed their clothes, she saw a black dirty rabbit. She picked up the rabbit and bathed it in the water.

Instead she fought the witch with all her might. As Felicia and the witch were fighting, they didn't notice that the rabbit fell into the water. Felicia did not hesitate to swim into the water and save the drowning rabbit.. Oh my poor, dear rabbit please wake up", she said as she hugged the dying rabbit.

                            14. Box Full of Kisses Some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, "This is for you, Daddy." The man became embarrassed by his over-reaction earlier, but his rage continued when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her, "Don't you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They're all for you, Daddy." The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. Her father kept the gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there (https wealthygon llaco 10-most-inspirational-short-sorus) Moral of the story: Love is the most precious gift in the world.

While the girl was lying on the bed and her father was sitting near to her, the girl asked, “Daddy, am I going to die?” father replied, “No dear, you will live.” The father gave her warm hug and kissed her on her forehead and left weeping. The girl said, “How can you be so sure daddy?” Father turned around and replied, “I know” and smile.After some time the girl got treated and was recovering, at same time she turned 13. After she came home, she found a letter on her bed.	My Sweet Kid, if you are reading this, it means everything went well as I told you. Do you remember?

                        <p>It's okay If I would kiss a snake or not.</p><p>It depends on the snakes mood, temperament, and where you plan to plant it. Pet snakes that are used to being held probably I won't mind, but again, I don't know the mood of the snake or even if the snake wouldn't respond to it as an instictual. So maybe you can kiss a snake, I think the best would be to blow the kisses from afar.</p><br />
