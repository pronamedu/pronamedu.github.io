                                            plsss help meein ten sentences, summarize the short story below.The Prodigal Son (Bible Story)There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first son was hard working. He always obey his father.He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He didnot work in his father's field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a happy and free life.One day, the younger son said to his father. "Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad.He divided the property. The second son took his share of properly. He left home with his share. He went to a distantland. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his money lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many badhabits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him oneby oneAt that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food ormoney. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept forthe pige. He was very sad about his present condition. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He saidto himself. "In my father's house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I amstruggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father's house. In the meantime, his father was always thinkingof his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son onthe way. His son knelt down. He said, "Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant."His father lifted him lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, "Bring the best robe. Putit on my son. Put a ning on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted call. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy.My son was lost. Now he is found."The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from the house.He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told him, "Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at hisretum. A fatted call has been killed to prepare for a grand celebration."The first son was angry. He refused to enter the house. The father came out' He begged his elder son tocome in for rejoicing. The elder son said, "I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But younever gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you ordered afatted call for him!"His father replied, "My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother wasdead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his youngerbrother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.​</a>

                                            You like money, right? Most people do. But what is it really worth? Usually, it will buy the goods and services that you expect. But sometimes it's worth less than the paper that it's printed on. I know that sounds hard to believe, but it's happened before.
During World War I, the French and the Germans fought one another fiercely. The war exacted a tremendous cost on both sides. Millions died. Billions of dollars were spent. The French paid for their efforts by taxing their citizens. But the Germans borrowed money to pay for the war. As the war raged on and the Germans borrowed more and more money, the value of their currency dropped.
In those days, the Germans called their money Marks. When World War I started in 1914, a US Dollar was worth around four German Marks. In 1919, after the war ended, a US Dollar was worth about nine German Marks. That means that Germans needed to spend twice as much money to buy the same items after the war. This is called inflation. Since people usually don't start earning twice as much money out of nowhere, it can be a real problem.
While 100% inflation over five years sounds pretty bad, things got much worse after the war. The countries that fought against Germany were upset with them. The French were perhaps most upset. Much of the fighting took place in France, and the country was ravaged. Since France and her allies won the war, they got to set the terms of surrender. France wanted billions of dollars each year. They demanded payments in foreign money, like the US Dollar, not in German Marks.
It was early 1921 by the time these agreements were made. One US Dollar could buy 60 German Marks. Then the Germans started making payments. Things soon spiraled out of control. The Germans made these payments by printing money. They would trade the money that they printed for foreign currency. But as they printed more and more, the money was worth less and less.  In November of 1921, one US Dollar was worth 330 Marks. A year later, one US Dollar was worth 800 German Marks.
The German government grew desperate. They began to trade Marks for foreign money at any rate. This only made things worse. By November of 1923, one US Dollar could buy 4,210,500,000,000 Marks.  That is not a typo. The number is 4 trillion. Their money was devalued so fast that German workers had to go to the store right after getting paid. If they waited until the day's end, their money would be worthless. Basic items like stamps and loaves of bread cost billions of Marks. Germans had to figure their expenses in thousands of billions. That made it tough to get through the day if you lacked strong math skills. Some burned the old bills to provide heat. The Marks' value as a fuel had increased beyond its value as a currency.
That the German economy ever recovered is something of a miracle, but it did recover. They created a new currency called the Retenmark. Unlike the old Marks, the new Retenmark was backed by land and gold. This means the currency could be traded for gold or land at a fixed rate. This also meant that the government could only print as much money as they had land and gold to back it. That turned out to be a good thing. By December of 1923, the Retenmark was the official currency. The Germans cut 12 zeros from the prices of their products and it was business as usual. Though they still had a lot of issues to work out, the money was stable. That made life a lot more livable. So while you are out chasing after money, remember that money is little more than a promise, and that promises can be broken. What is one lesson that can be learned from the text?

"The Story of the Disobedient Son"
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first so was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
At that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present conditions. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant." So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant." His father lifted his lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy. My son was lost. Now he is fount."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told his, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore, should we not rejoice?" The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.</a>

Modern Generation Youth: Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY: Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modern generation youth wants to enjoy the gin freedom He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking bung jumping etc. Today's youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries in other word they want to live energized lives. It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an op interaction with their parents. Thus, the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need spec counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading" is opinion of majonty of the elderly people. They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcohol smoking, drug and an attempt to commit suicide etc. "The style of dressing of the youth is turning from bad to worse" is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns and peop in general. They feel that there should be a certain kind of decency in their code of dressing be it at home colleg workplace or the church, temple, mosque and gurudwara The major factor which needs to be taken care off in context of the youth is the ever-increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evil due to lack of lo and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up suicide. So therefore, my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent because th can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make society. By this I mean it is the youth who can implement the laws and make the required changes to bring abou progress in our society. And thus, look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with youth is good or not it's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands.

                                            Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</a>

Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chi, is going tocommence operations against Chwan-yu."3. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here?4. "Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over thesacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; and itsruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do withattacking it?5. Zan Yu said, "Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.6. Confucius said, "Ch iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, "When he can put forth his abilty,he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retiresfrom it. how can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering nor raise him up when fallen? "And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when atortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?"8. Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief does not now takeit, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants."9. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, the superior man hates that declining to say"I want such and such a thing." and framing explanations for the conduct.10. "I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.11. "So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, theymust be made contented and tranquil.12. "Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory, there are divisions anddownfalls, leavings and separations, and, wilh your help, he cannot preserve it.13. "And yet, he is planning these hostile movements within the State.-I am afraid that the sorrow bof the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen oftheir own court."Chapter II.1. Confucius said, "When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitivemilitary expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire,ceremonies, musiC, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these thingsproceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power inten generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the princes, as a rule, the cases willbe few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers ofthe great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in whichthey do not lose their power in three generations.4. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the Greatofficers.3. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the commonpeople."Book XVIII. Wei TszeChapter I1. The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pkan remonstrated with him and died.2. Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue"Chapter IIHui of Liu-hsia being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Someone said to him "Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this" he replied, "Serving men in an upright waywhere shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? if choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?Source: James Legge (translator), The Chinese Classics, volume 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893​</a>

(15 PTS.)Modern Generation Youth: Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and YouthsBY: Christine TorcatoThe youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modern generation youth wants to enjoy the ginfreedom He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking bungjumping etc. Today's youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries in other wordthey want to live energized lives. It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an opinteraction with their parents. Thus, the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need speccounselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading" isopinion of majonty of the elderly people. They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcohol smoking, drugand an attempt to commit suicide etc."The style of dressing of the youth is turning from bad to worse" is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns and peopin general. They feel that there should be a certain kind of decency in their code of dressing be it at home collegworkplace or the church, temple, mosque and gurudwara The major factor which needs to be taken care off incontext of the youth is the ever-increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evil due to lack of loand affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter ofstudies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not forexcellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take upsuicide. So therefore, my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent because thcan brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or makesociety. By this I mean it is the youth who can implement the laws and make the required changes to bring abouprogress in our society. And thus, look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict withyouth is good or not it's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands.1.

I just want to explore through your minds, i wanna know what are your thoughts to the question i will ask for you. In addition, I want to be fair so I'm going to add an additional points ^^ so here's the question:REBORN1. In your past life, you died once. You were given a chance to live again in order to correct all those misunderstanding that has happened in the past. What will you do now that you have learned all the things that has happened to you? Will you just let bygones be bygones? answer.REINCARNATION2. You reincarnated not only once but twice, the reincarnation that has happened to you twice in your life was really unfortunate. You didn't do a good deeds thus you did a bad one. What happened to you in your first reincarnation has also fated to be the same as the second reincarnation. Now that you're reincarnated for the third time, will you correct all your mistakes that you have done in your past life now that you've given a another chance? Will you still do the same?(oof it's actually tiring to type this long uwu &gt;•&lt;)Now here comes the interesting one *inserting a devil smile* :&gt;TIMETRAVELLING3. Comes to the weird and unfamilliar surroundings, old but elegant things are displayed. You suddenly realized that you're not in your house but you're in SOMEBODY'S house. Elegant house, beautiful views ANNDD you have actually mistaken into someone. That someone is whom highly respected and you knew from the start that you actually don't know where you are now. You ask some people around you what date is it now and suddenly you were shocked by its answer. Now that it slipped through your mind that you are in TimeTravel, what will you do in order to go back in modern/old times? Will you continue to live in those period as someone? 3 question in a rowww HAHA. the last question is a little bit complicated but who knows whether you understand the question or not:&gt;. I just hope you will answer this honestly, you don't need to prove to me that you're a genius or whatever, what i need is if someone out there may answer this correctly or honestly it means that person has a great comprehension. no need to pressure yourself, I also just want to express my thoughts by asking these questions:)goodluck! thank you for giving me your time^^​</a>

                                            The Prodigal Son
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first son was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was a very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
AT that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present condition. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."
So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home. 
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant."
His father lifted him lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy ourselves. My son was lost. Now he is fond."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told him, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your work. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"
The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.

The first son was hard working. He always obey his father.He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He didnot work in his father's field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a happy and free life.One day, the younger son said to his father. "Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad.He divided the property. The second son took his share of properly. He left home with his share. He went to a distantland. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his money lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many badhabits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him oneby oneAt that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food ormoney. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept forthe pige. He was very sad about his present condition. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He saidto himself. "In my father's house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I amstruggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father's house. In the meantime, his father was always thinkingof his second son. He would sit near the windows.

                            6. You like money, right? Most people do. But what is it really worth? Usually, it will buy the goods and services that you expect. But sometimes it's worth less than the paper that it's printed on. I know that sounds hard to believe, but it's happened before.
During World War I, the French and the Germans fought one another fiercely. The war exacted a tremendous cost on both sides. Millions died. Billions of dollars were spent. The French paid for their efforts by taxing their citizens. But the Germans borrowed money to pay for the war. As the war raged on and the Germans borrowed more and more money, the value of their currency dropped.
In those days, the Germans called their money Marks. When World War I started in 1914, a US Dollar was worth around four German Marks. In 1919, after the war ended, a US Dollar was worth about nine German Marks. That means that Germans needed to spend twice as much money to buy the same items after the war. This is called inflation. Since people usually don't start earning twice as much money out of nowhere, it can be a real problem.
While 100% inflation over five years sounds pretty bad, things got much worse after the war. The countries that fought against Germany were upset with them. The French were perhaps most upset. Much of the fighting took place in France, and the country was ravaged. Since France and her allies won the war, they got to set the terms of surrender. France wanted billions of dollars each year. They demanded payments in foreign money, like the US Dollar, not in German Marks.
It was early 1921 by the time these agreements were made. One US Dollar could buy 60 German Marks. Then the Germans started making payments. Things soon spiraled out of control. The Germans made these payments by printing money. They would trade the money that they printed for foreign currency. But as they printed more and more, the money was worth less and less.  In November of 1921, one US Dollar was worth 330 Marks. A year later, one US Dollar was worth 800 German Marks.
The German government grew desperate. They began to trade Marks for foreign money at any rate. This only made things worse. By November of 1923, one US Dollar could buy 4,210,500,000,000 Marks.  That is not a typo. The number is 4 trillion. Their money was devalued so fast that German workers had to go to the store right after getting paid. If they waited until the day's end, their money would be worthless. Basic items like stamps and loaves of bread cost billions of Marks. Germans had to figure their expenses in thousands of billions. That made it tough to get through the day if you lacked strong math skills. Some burned the old bills to provide heat. The Marks' value as a fuel had increased beyond its value as a currency.
That the German economy ever recovered is something of a miracle, but it did recover. They created a new currency called the Retenmark. Unlike the old Marks, the new Retenmark was backed by land and gold. This means the currency could be traded for gold or land at a fixed rate. This also meant that the government could only print as much money as they had land and gold to back it. That turned out to be a good thing. By December of 1923, the Retenmark was the official currency. The Germans cut 12 zeros from the prices of their products and it was business as usual. Though they still had a lot of issues to work out, the money was stable. That made life a lot more livable. So while you are out chasing after money, remember that money is little more than a promise, and that promises can be broken. What is one lesson that can be learned from the text? Support your answer with quotes from the text. Explain your quotes and your argument thoroughly.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One lesson that can be learned from the text is that inflation can have severe consequences on an economy and its people. The text provides a historical example of hyperinflation in Germany after World War I, where the value of their currency dropped rapidly, leading to skyrocketing prices of goods and services. As the text explains, "Since people usually don't start earning twice as much money out of nowhere, it can be a real problem" (paragraph 2).</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the text highlights the devastating effects of inflation on people's everyday lives, such as the need to buy basic items like bread and stamps for billions of Marks and the difficulty of figuring out expenses in thousands of billions. The text states, "Germans had to figure their expenses in thousands of billions. That made it tough to get through the day if you lacked strong math skills" (paragraph 5).</p><p></p><p>The text also suggests that a stable currency is crucial for a functioning economy and a better quality of life for people. The introduction of the new currency, the Retenmark, which was backed by land and gold and had a fixed rate of exchange, helped stabilize the German economy and restore confidence in their currency. The text notes, "By December of 1923, the Retenmark was the official currency. The Germans cut 12 zeros from the prices of their products and it was business as usual. Though they still had a lot of issues to work out, the money was stable. That made life a lot more livable" (paragraph 7).</p><p></p><p>In summary, the text highlights the negative consequences of inflation, the importance of a stable currency, and the need for governments to manage their economies carefully to prevent hyperinflation and its disastrous effects on the lives of their citizens.</p><br />

The prince was mean and rude towards the people of his kingdom. He mocked and made fun of all the girls that he saw along his way. One day a visitor arrived in the kingdom. It was an old ugly woman. When he saw the visitor the prince laughed so hard and mocked the old woman. The old woman got angry and pointed her finger at the prince and cast a spell. "I will turn you into an ugly black rabbit for being such a mean and bad mannered person. Poof! the prince instantly turned into a black rabbit. "Only when someone takes pity and sheds a tear for you will the spell be broken." On the other side of the kingdom there was a river and on its riverbank was the house of a beautiful girl named Felicia. She was a beautiful and kindhearted girl. Every morning Felicia would go to the river to wash their clothes. One day as she washed their clothes, she saw a black dirty rabbit. She picked up the rabbit and bathed it in the water. She felt pity for the poor rabbit so, she decided to bring the rabbit to her house. As she walked towards home she met an old woman. When the old woman saw the rabbit she claimed that the rabbit was hers. She asked Felicia to give her the rabbit. But the rabbit cried and held on tightly to Felicia's arms. The old woman got angry and turned herself into an evil witch. "Give me my Rabbit! I am Its master!" But Felicia was not afraid of the witch. She did not let go the rabbit. Instead she fought the witch with all her might. As Felicia and the witch were fighting, they didn't notice that the rabbit fell into the water. Felicia did not hesitate to swim into the water and save the drowning rabbit.. Oh my poor, dear rabbit please wake up", she said as she hugged the dying rabbit. She was crying so hard that her tears fell onto the rabbit's body. Suddenly the rabbit turned into a handsome prince. The prince thanked her for saving his life. He kissed Felicia.The prince and Felicia went back to his kingdom and they lived happily ever after.Answer the following questions.1. Who are the characters of the story? A.

"The Story of the Disobedient Son"
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first so was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
At that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present conditions. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant." So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant." His father lifted his lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy. My son was lost. Now he is fount."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told his, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore, should we not rejoice?" The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are two main characters in the story "The Story of the Disobedient Son": the first son and the second son. The first son is described as hardworking, obedient, and a good and nice person. The second son, on the other hand, is described as lazy, disobedient, and wanting to lead a free and carefree life. The second son also has bad habits and wastes his money, leading him to become poor and take a job feeding pigs. In contrast, the first son is obedient and works hard, but becomes angry when he sees his father celebrating the return of the second son. The father is a loving and forgiving character who is always thinking of his second son and rejoices at his return. Overall, the first son is portrayed as responsible and dutiful, while the second son is portrayed as reckless and irresponsible.</p><br />

Modern Generation Youth: Inappropriate Behaviour In Kids and Youths BY: Christine Torcato The youth of today forms a major section of our society. The modern generation youth wants to enjoy the gin freedom He/she basically wants to live a life full of adventures, such as enjoying activities like trekking bung jumping etc. Today's youth want to live a life full of excitement and not just of tensions and worries in other word they want to live energized lives. It is observed that the youth do face a lot of problems when it comes to an op interaction with their parents. Thus, the psychologists recommended that both parents and children need spec counselling that will try and bring solutions to their problems. "Presently the status of the youth is degrading" is opinion of majonty of the elderly people. They have taken to all sorts of temptations such as alcohol smoking, drug and an attempt to commit suicide etc. "The style of dressing of the youth is turning from bad to worse" is the opinion of some of the priests, nuns and peop in general. They feel that there should be a certain kind of decency in their code of dressing be it at home colleg workplace or the church, temple, mosque and gurudwara The major factor which needs to be taken care off in context of the youth is the ever-increasing rate of suicide. Some youths take up to this major evil due to lack of lo and affection. The other factor could be the pressure put by the parents on the children in the matter of studies. To some extent this type of behaviour is agreeable for children who are weak in their studies but not for excellent students. These children who are excellent in their studies go through depression and hence take up suicide. So therefore, my only plea is to please let the youth lead their carefree lives to a certain extent because th can brighten our future and help let us live a better tomorrow. The youth are the ones who can break or make society. By this I mean it is the youth who can implement the laws and make the required changes to bring abou progress in our society. And thus, look at the advantages side of it and then decide whether being too strict with youth is good or not it's all up to you dear parents to secure your child's future in your hands.

                            11. Ki, a Pygmy, has married a Pygmy girl from another village. The girl was called Luetsi and she was became Ki’s wife. With them lived Ntio, Ki’s brother. After a year, Luetsi wished to visit her mother, as was the custom. Ki agreed and gave Luetsi a big piece of meat to take to her mother. As a big hunt was imminent, Ki could not go with his wife, but he promised to fetch her from her mother’s house in four weeks time.Now it happened that Ki was bitten in the foot by a snake and he could mot walk. So he asked his brother to fetch his wife. Ntio did not want to go and said, “In a few days’ time you will be able to walk again. It is better for you to fetch your wife yourself.”“No”, said Ki. “It’s better not to live Luetsi uncertainty. She would not wait for me but would start a journey home alone. Fetch her home for me and I will give you my best bow.”So Ntio went and fetched Luetsi. They took the path through the jungle, the woman ahead, the man armed closed behind her as was the proper.Suddenly, a leopard appeared among the trees, and it crouched ready to spring. The woman was paralyzed with fear. Ntio, however, threw himself on the leopard and thrust a knife to the leopard’s heart. As it fell, the claws tore open Ntio’s shoulder. Then the beast fell dead. Luetsi cleansed Ntio’s wounds, dressed it with healing herbs, and put a bandage around it. Then she said, “You Are brave Ntio. You saved my life. I wonder if Ki would have done as much for me.”“You ought to say such things,” said Ntio.But Luetsi continued, “One has heard of men who allowed their wives to be eaten by leopards, while they themselves disappeared faster than a snake.”“Not my brother Ki,” protested Ntio.Then Luetsi said, “I have no child of his own. It is because he does not love me enough.”“You should not talk such nonsense,” said Ntio. “He loves you. And he does not lack courage either. Perhaps he is the bravest among us three.”“Let’s put it to a test!” said Luetsi suddenly.“What do you mean?” inquired Ntio.Eagerly Luetsi told him “I shall lie down as if the leopard had jumped on me and pinned me to the ground. You roll the leopard over on top of me, so it would like it’s about to eat me up. Then run to Ki as fast as you can, tell him that the leopard attacked me, and bring him here.”“Very well,” said Ntio. He did what Luetsi ordered him.And so Luetsi lied there for hours beneath the dead leopard. In the distance she could hear the roar of the leopardess looking for its mate. The jungle was full of threatening voices. At last she tried to imagine that the leopard lying on top of her was moving. Nut she did not budge from the spot so keen was she to find out how her husband would behave.Meanwhile, Ntio had arrived at the village. He burst into the hut and told his brother the things Luetsi want to say to test him. Ki sprang to his feet without delay, and in spite of his bad foot condition, he ran after his brother. Soon indeed, he overtook him, and although he was unarmed, he threw himself on the leopard.The woman rolled the dead beast over and stood up laughing.“What does this mean?” asked Ki.“I wanted to test who among us three is the bravest!” said Luetsi.And that is the question, who is the bravest?Was it Ntio, who stabbed the leopard in the heart? Or Luetsi who lay beneath the leopard? Or Ki who ran up to save his wife despite of his condition? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Well For me it's definitely Ki because even though unarmed and with a bad foot condition his ready to save/, sacrifice himself for his wife.</p><br />

The last paragraph mentions a principle that people should seek their own place and origin within the society, what does this mean? 6. What ideal state of governance could be inferred from the selection?the storyBook XVI. Ke SheChapter I.1. The head of the Chi family was going to attack Chwan-yu.2. Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chi, is going tocommence operations against Chwan-yu."3. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here?4. "Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over thesacrifices to the eastern Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; and itsruler is a minister in direct connection with the sovereign: What has your chief to do withattacking it?5. Zan Yu said, "Our master wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it.6. Confucius said, "Ch iu, there are the words of Chau Zan, "When he can put forth his abilty,he takes his place in the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he retiresfrom it. how can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does not support him when tottering nor raise him up when fallen? "And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when atortoise or piece of jade is injured in its repository:-whose is the fault?"8. Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and near to Pi; if our chief does not now takeit, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants."9. Confucius said, "Ch'iu, the superior man hates that declining to say"I want such and such a thing." and framing explanations for the conduct.10. "I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.11. "So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, theymust be made contented and tranquil.12. "Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own territory, there are divisions anddownfalls, leavings and separations, and, wilh your help, he cannot preserve it.13. "And yet, he is planning these hostile movements within the State.-I am afraid that the sorrow bof the Chi-sun family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found within the screen oftheir own court."Chapter II.1. Confucius said, "When good government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitivemilitary expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When bad government prevails in the empire,ceremonies, musiC, and punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When these thingsproceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power inten generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the princes, as a rule, the cases willbe few in which they do not lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary ministers ofthe great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in whichthey do not lose their power in three generations.4. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, government will not be in the hands of the Greatofficers.3. When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there will be no discussions among the commonpeople."Book XVIII. Wei TszeChapter I1. The Viscount of Wei withdrew from the court. The Viscount of Chi became a slave to Chau. Pkan remonstrated with him and died.2. Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue"Chapter IIHui of Liu-hsia being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from his office. Someone said to him "Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leave this" he replied, "Serving men in an upright waywhere shall I go to, and not experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? if choose to serve men in a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents?Source: James Legge (translator), The Chinese Classics, volume 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1893​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Rulers of the state and chiefs of families are most troubled about maintaining order and keeping their people in their designated places within society. They are concerned with ensuring that the people are content and at peace, rather than worried about poverty or the number of people in their society.</p><p></p><p>The state should satisfy the people by ensuring that they are content in their designated places within society and by promoting harmony and order. It should also cultivate virtues and civil culture to attract and subdue any unruly or rebellious people.</p><p></p><p>The principle mentioned in the last paragraph is that people should strive to fulfill their designated roles within society and not try to rise above their place or seek power that is not rightfully theirs. This means that people should be content with their position and not try to disrupt the social order.</p><p></p><p>The ideal state of governance inferred from the selection is one where the rulers are concerned with the contentment and well-being of the people, and where the people fulfill their designated roles within society. This state is characterized by harmony, order, and virtue, and is governed by principles of justice and fairness.</p><br />

I just want to explore through your minds, i wanna know what are your thoughts to the question i will ask for you. In addition, I want to be fair so I'm going to add an additional points ^^ so here's the question:REBORN1. In your past life, you died once. You were given a chance to live again in order to correct all those misunderstanding that has happened in the past. What will you do now that you have learned all the things that has happened to you? Will you just let bygones be bygones? answer.REINCARNATION2. You reincarnated not only once but twice, the reincarnation that has happened to you twice in your life was really unfortunate. You didn't do a good deeds thus you did a bad one. What happened to you in your first reincarnation has also fated to be the same as the second reincarnation. Now that you're reincarnated for the third time, will you correct all your mistakes that you have done in your past life now that you've given a another chance? Will you still do the same?(oof it's actually tiring to type this long uwu &gt;•&lt;)Now here comes the interesting one *inserting a devil smile* :&gt;TIMETRAVELLING3. Comes to the weird and unfamilliar surroundings, old but elegant things are displayed. You suddenly realized that you're not in your house but you're in SOMEBODY'S house. Elegant house, beautiful views ANNDD you have actually mistaken into someone. That someone is whom highly respected and you knew from the start that you actually don't know where you are now. You ask some people around you what date is it now and suddenly you were shocked by its answer. Now that it slipped through your mind that you are in TimeTravel, what will you do in order to go back in modern/old times? Will you continue to live in those period as someone? 3 question in a rowww HAHA. the last question is a little bit complicated but who knows whether you understand the question or not:&gt;. I just hope you will answer this honestly, you don't need to prove to me that you're a genius or whatever, what i need is if someone out there may answer this correctly or honestly it means that person has a great comprehension. no need to pressure yourself, I also just want to express my thoughts by asking these questions:)goodluck! thank you for giving me your time^^​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I'll try my very best to be a better person with all those knowledge.

I would live my life the way i wanted to. and won't really care if it'll change something or not. my third reincarnation may fail, but I'll sure make it worth it.</p><p></p><p>3. I would rather find my way back to time, and go back to my previous life. and if this thing i'm experiencing now is probably the future. i want to know how it happens.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>MOOH</p><br />

                            22. The Prodigal Son
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first son was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was a very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
AT that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present condition. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."
So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home. 
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant."
His father lifted him lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy ourselves. My son was lost. Now he is fond."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told him, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your work. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"
The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.
