Inanimate objects such as a bed have legs which act as supports for the bed to rest/stand on. But they are not said to have separate feet. Besides, a bed has a head end as well as a foot end. When we sleep on bed, our feet are towards the foot end. Hence, we say that a bed has four legs but only one foot.</p><br />
