As the light heats the ice, it may be warming up dust grains located deep within These grains would then store heat, as ice is very absorbent of infrared radiation, This could allow for the formation of small spreads of liquid water deep underground, even if only for the duration of the day. The effect has been discovered in Antarctica as well Sunlight may be helping the formation of underground ponds and pockets of liquid water So the leader of this new investigation sees no reason as to why this shouldn't also hold true for Mars.

                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                                            Instruction: Write a complete poem from this text: Importance of Asian Literature The historical experiences of people in Asia have been interwoven for centuries if not millennia, owing to their close and vast geography as well as years of trade and conquests. Naturally, while each Asian country has a unique literary style, their literature also reflects the similarities in their customs and traditions, struggles and successes, even their philosophies in life, giving the rest of the world a better understanding of Asian culture. This is hugely important especially to Western people in the past since they did not know a lot of Asia, much less its people’s ways of living, due to both their geographic and cultural distances. The differences between Western and Eastern culture manifests even until today. However, Asian literature brings their people’s lives straight from reality to the pages that then take their stories into the hearts of others worldwide, where they somehow find a common ground of shared experiences. Asian literature goes to show that despite the distance and differences, we are all connected through the tales that we have in common with each other. Not only does Asian literature give us an original and fresh take on people’s experiences, but it also contributes to our collective perception of life through the morals and philosophies that their literary pieces embody. One Thousand and One Nights, a collection of Arabian folk tales, is the epitome of the value-centered pieces of Asian literature. In its hundreds of stories, just as many moral lessons can be gleaned. To name a few, Aladdin’s Wonderful Lamp teaches us the meaning of identity and how it is based on merit, not wealth; Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves characterizes loyalty, honesty, and generosity; The Tale of the Hunchback calls out to the persistence of truth and our conscience. Asian literature has also aided the spread of Asian spirituality, heightening the major religions that we know and are a part of until today—all of which started in the continent itself: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam having originated from West Asia, Hinduism and Buddhism from the South, and Confucianism and Taoism from the East. Examples of literary texts that support religions range from the Tao Te Ching that exemplifies Taoism, the Analects that epitomizes Confucianism, to the Sanskrit epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata that are important to Hinduism, amongst many others that knit the patchwork of Asian religions. Asian literature has impacted our lives, whether we know it or not. It is there in the way that we view certain aspects of life—such as struggles, injustices, death—, and it is there in the way that we treat life itself. Throughout the years and until today, all over the world, Asian literature has helped shape our ideals and lifestyles. It is only right that we trace the origins of such a powerful medium that has moved our minds.​</a>

                                            How Identical Is Identical?     Everyone knows that identical twins look alike, night? Not quite. Although it may be very hard to tell identical twins apart, no two people are exactly the same even identical twins. Identical twins develop from the same fertilized egg, so they share the same genes. Genes contain the information that determines people's physical traits. While most people have their own unique set of genetic instructions, identical twins are unusual because they both have the same set. But researchers have discovered that those instructions do not tell the entire story. The environment in which each twin grows and develops also affects many aspects of their physical appearance and personality. Even small differences can have considerable effects. Fingerprints are a good example. One might assume that identical twins have the same tingerprints. But detectives have known for many years that this is not the case. Like snowflakes, no two fingerprints are alike. Unique pattems on the tips of the fingers appear as the child develops in the womb. While genetic instructions are the primary influence on fingerprint pattems, researchers have discovered other factors that also have an impact. The rate of bone growth, or environmental factors such as pressure in the mother's womb and contact with fluid, can also affect the developing twins' fingerprint patterns. So even though two twins grow next to each other in the womb, they experience slightly different environments. As a result, they develop slightly different fingerprints.1. According to the author, the fact that twins do NOT have identical fingerprints prove that_________.A.they are not actually twinsB.no two people are exactly alikeC.genetic patterns do not affect appearanceD.twins often have different personalities2. Which of the following is NOT  an environmental factor that can still affect fingerprint patterns? *A.contact with fluidB.rate of bone growthC.pressure in the wombD. how twins are raised3. Evidence in the passage suggests that_______.A.twins often have the same thoughtsB.the shape of snowflake is determined by genesC.environmental affects people more than their genes doD.genetics and environment affect growth4. Evidence in the passage suggests that the physical differences between identical twins are usually_______.A.significantB.impossible to determineC.measured after birth D.small5. What makes having unique fingerprints a positive quality?Your answer:​</a>

As the light heats the ice, it may be warming up dust grains located deep within These grains would then store heat, as ice is very absorbent of infrared radiation, This could allow for the formation of small spreads of liquid water deep underground, even if only for the duration of the day.

                            4. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced? Why?kailangan ko po asap pls help me?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Cheating</p><p>2. Cheating is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students.</p><p>3. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials, can create mistrust, and sour the relationship between teachers and students, and bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace.</p><p>4. I agree with the reason that I believe, rather than cheat, students must learn how to balance their own time between studying and relaxing to be more productive, honest, and good students. Surround yourself with peers who are good influences when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere, and learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat.</p><p></p><p>:))</p><br />

                            7. Instruction: Write a complete poem from this text: Importance of Asian Literature The historical experiences of people in Asia have been interwoven for centuries if not millennia, owing to their close and vast geography as well as years of trade and conquests. Naturally, while each Asian country has a unique literary style, their literature also reflects the similarities in their customs and traditions, struggles and successes, even their philosophies in life, giving the rest of the world a better understanding of Asian culture. This is hugely important especially to Western people in the past since they did not know a lot of Asia, much less its people’s ways of living, due to both their geographic and cultural distances. The differences between Western and Eastern culture manifests even until today. However, Asian literature brings their people’s lives straight from reality to the pages that then take their stories into the hearts of others worldwide, where they somehow find a common ground of shared experiences. Asian literature goes to show that despite the distance and differences, we are all connected through the tales that we have in common with each other. Not only does Asian literature give us an original and fresh take on people’s experiences, but it also contributes to our collective perception of life through the morals and philosophies that their literary pieces embody. One Thousand and One Nights, a collection of Arabian folk tales, is the epitome of the value-centered pieces of Asian literature. In its hundreds of stories, just as many moral lessons can be gleaned. To name a few, Aladdin’s Wonderful Lamp teaches us the meaning of identity and how it is based on merit, not wealth; Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves characterizes loyalty, honesty, and generosity; The Tale of the Hunchback calls out to the persistence of truth and our conscience. Asian literature has also aided the spread of Asian spirituality, heightening the major religions that we know and are a part of until today—all of which started in the continent itself: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam having originated from West Asia, Hinduism and Buddhism from the South, and Confucianism and Taoism from the East. Examples of literary texts that support religions range from the Tao Te Ching that exemplifies Taoism, the Analects that epitomizes Confucianism, to the Sanskrit epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata that are important to Hinduism, amongst many others that knit the patchwork of Asian religions. Asian literature has impacted our lives, whether we know it or not. It is there in the way that we view certain aspects of life—such as struggles, injustices, death—, and it is there in the way that we treat life itself. Throughout the years and until today, all over the world, Asian literature has helped shape our ideals and lifestyles. It is only right that we trace the origins of such a powerful medium that has moved our minds.​</h2><br />

                            8. How Identical Is Identical?     Everyone knows that identical twins look alike, night? Not quite. Although it may be very hard to tell identical twins apart, no two people are exactly the same even identical twins. Identical twins develop from the same fertilized egg, so they share the same genes. Genes contain the information that determines people's physical traits. While most people have their own unique set of genetic instructions, identical twins are unusual because they both have the same set. But researchers have discovered that those instructions do not tell the entire story. The environment in which each twin grows and develops also affects many aspects of their physical appearance and personality. Even small differences can have considerable effects. Fingerprints are a good example. One might assume that identical twins have the same tingerprints. But detectives have known for many years that this is not the case. Like snowflakes, no two fingerprints are alike. Unique pattems on the tips of the fingers appear as the child develops in the womb. While genetic instructions are the primary influence on fingerprint pattems, researchers have discovered other factors that also have an impact. The rate of bone growth, or environmental factors such as pressure in the mother's womb and contact with fluid, can also affect the developing twins' fingerprint patterns. So even though two twins grow next to each other in the womb, they experience slightly different environments. As a result, they develop slightly different fingerprints.1. According to the author, the fact that twins do NOT have identical fingerprints prove that_________.A.they are not actually twinsB.no two people are exactly alikeC.genetic patterns do not affect appearanceD.twins often have different personalities2. Which of the following is NOT  an environmental factor that can still affect fingerprint patterns? *A.contact with fluidB.rate of bone growthC.pressure in the wombD. how twins are raised3. Evidence in the passage suggests that_______.A.twins often have the same thoughtsB.the shape of snowflake is determined by genesC.environmental affects people more than their genes doD.genetics and environment affect growth4.
