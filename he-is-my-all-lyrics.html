BOHOLANO LYRIC POEM
From Region VII
And in the midst of these gem-like Islands,
Is one more blessed with singular beauty,
Gowned in the green of emeralds,
Skirted by beaches of alabaster sands,
And crowned in splendor by deep-blue 
heights.
Others call her Paradise,
But the natives of the place call her,
Bohol . . .
This is Bohol . . .
Land of the endless charms, mystery and 
the 
Perpetual sun; land of the cone-shaped
Chocolate Hills, of verdant plains, crystal
Watercourses, underground pools,
Virgin forest, and powdery
White sands.
This is Bohol

Magellan
By Yoyoy Villame
On March 16, 1521
When Philippines was discovered by 
Magellan
They were sailing day and night across 
the big ocean
Until they saw a small Limasawa island
Magellan landed in Limasawa at noon
The people met him very welcome on the 
shore
They did not understand the speaking 
they have done
Because Kastila gid at Waray-Waray 
man
When Magellan landed in Cebu City
Rajah Humabon met him, they were very 
happy
All people were baptized and built the 
church of Christ
And that’s the beginning of our Catholic 
life
When Magellan visited in Mactan
To christianize them everyone
But Lapu-Lapu met him on the shore
and drive Magellan to go back home
Then Magellan got so mad
Ordered his men to camouflage
“Mactan island we could not grab
‘Cause Lapu Lapu is very hard”
Then the battle began at dawn
Bolos and spears versus guns and
cannons
When Magellan was hit on his neck
He stumble down and cried and cried

BOHOLANO LYRIC POEM
From Region VII
And in the midst of these gem-like Islands,
Is one more blessed with singular beauty,
Gowned in the green of emeralds,
Skirted by beaches of alabaster sands,
And crowned in splendor by deep-blue 
heights.
Others call her Paradise,
But the natives of the place call her,
Bohol . . .
This is Bohol . . .
Land of the endless charms, mystery and 
the 
Perpetual sun; land of the cone-shaped
Chocolate Hills, of verdant plains, crystal
Watercourses, underground pools,
Virgin forest, and powdery
White sands.
This is Bohol

Magellan
By Yoyoy Villame
On March 16, 1521
When Philippines was discovered by 
Magellan
They were sailing day and night across 
the big ocean
Until they saw a small Limasawa island
Magellan landed in Limasawa at noon
The people met him very welcome on the 
shore
They did not understand the speaking 
they have done
Because Kastila gid at Waray-Waray 
man
When Magellan landed in Cebu City
Rajah Humabon met him, they were very 
happy
All people were baptized and built the 
church of Christ
And that’s the beginning of our Catholic 
life
When Magellan visited in Mactan
To christianize them everyone
But Lapu-Lapu met him on the shore
and drive Magellan to go back home
Then Magellan got so mad
Ordered his men to camouflage
“Mactan island we could not grab
‘Cause Lapu Lapu is very hard”
Then the battle began at dawn
Bolos and spears versus guns and
cannons
When Magellan was hit on his neck
He stumble down and cried and cried
