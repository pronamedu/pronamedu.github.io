                                            7. Researchers conducted an experiment to identify the effects of three different hand sanitizers on the growth of bacteria. The researchers grew one type of bacteria in twenty-four identical covered petri dishes. Then, they opened eighteen petri dishes and applied the three hand sanitizers to six petri dishes each. They left the remaining six petri dishes closed as a control group. When the researchers measured the growth of bacteria two days later, the six dishes that had no hand sanitizer showed the least amount of bacterial growth. The researchers concluded that not using any hand sanitizer would lead to the least bacterial growth. 
Which statement best explains why the researchers’ conclusion was not justified?
A. The experiment tested too many variables.
B. The control group was not treated the same as the experimental group.
C. The sample size of twenty-four petri dishes is not large enough.
D. The single type of bacteria is not adequate to make any conclusions.
8. In double-blind studies neither the test subject or the researcher knows who was given the drug and who was given the control. Why are these studies effective for testing a drug that may elevate mood and relieve feelings of depression? 
A. Since there are two symptoms that are affected, a double-blind study is required.
B. Double-blind studies are ways to ensure that only the researcher can figure out who is getting the effective drug.
C. Double-blind studies are the most economical way to gather results from testing on humans.
D. The patients and researchers are not given this information so they cannot be influenced in reporting the effectiveness

                            12. 7. Researchers conducted an experiment to identify the effects of three different hand sanitizers on the growth of bacteria. The researchers grew one type of bacteria in twenty-four identical covered petri dishes. Then, they opened eighteen petri dishes and applied the three hand sanitizers to six petri dishes each. They left the remaining six petri dishes closed as a control group. When the researchers measured the growth of bacteria two days later, the six dishes that had no hand sanitizer showed the least amount of bacterial growth. The researchers concluded that not using any hand sanitizer would lead to the least bacterial growth. 
Which statement best explains why the researchers’ conclusion was not justified?
A. The experiment tested too many variables.
B. The control group was not treated the same as the experimental group.
C. The sample size of twenty-four petri dishes is not large enough.
D. The single type of bacteria is not adequate to make any conclusions.
8. In double-blind studies neither the test subject or the researcher knows who was given the drug and who was given the control. Why are these studies effective for testing a drug that may elevate mood and relieve feelings of depression? 
A. Since there are two symptoms that are affected, a double-blind study is required.
B. Double-blind studies are ways to ensure that only the researcher can figure out who is getting the effective drug.
C. Double-blind studies are the most economical way to gather results from testing on humans.
D. The patients and researchers are not given this information so they cannot be influenced in reporting the effectiveness
