The reflected light keeps moving in a cursive line.4. Light bent if it hit a surface.5. Light reflects the same way off a mirror.1. Refraction is the bending of light2. Light refracts whenever it travels at an angle into an object or medium.3. The speed of light is slower in water.4. Forming of rainbow is an example of refraction.5. Bending of light occurs during reflection1. Light reflects in hard, smooth/shiny objects.2. Reflection and refraction are properties of light.3. The speed of the light during refraction slows down.4. Light bends during reflection.5. Light bounces during refraction.1. White light has different colors which is the color of the rainbow.2. The colors of the rainbow and all the other colors that we see around us arecolors that come from the light of the sun3. An object that absorbs all the colors look white in your eyes.4.

                                            In the past, when people went to war, they used spears or long knives. They
also used shields to protect themselves. Later, they used armors made of metal.
Even today soldiers go to combat using helmets.
Today, there are some instances when a head gear is necessary. In a
construction site, there are restricted areas called “hard hat” areas. In these areas,
workers are expected to wear head gears for protection, especially from falling
debris or other hard objects.
There is also a story of a young man who met a tragic death when the
motorcycle he was riding on smashed at a tree. His head was badly injured. If only
he wore a crash helmet, he could have escaped the tragedy. Today there is a law
requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets to protect their heads.
1.What is a “hard hat” area? How does it give protection to our body?
2.What is one requirement in riding a motorcycle? Is there a need to do so? If yes,
please support your answer with examples.</a>

                            24. In the past, when people went to war, they used spears or long knives. They
also used shields to protect themselves. Later, they used armors made of metal.
Even today soldiers go to combat using helmets.
Today, there are some instances when a head gear is necessary. In a
construction site, there are restricted areas called “hard hat” areas. In these areas,
workers are expected to wear head gears for protection, especially from falling
debris or other hard objects.
There is also a story of a young man who met a tragic death when the
motorcycle he was riding on smashed at a tree. His head was badly injured. If only
he wore a crash helmet, he could have escaped the tragedy. Today there is a law
requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets to protect their heads.
1.What is a “hard hat” area? How does it give protection to our body?
2.What is one requirement in riding a motorcycle? Is there a need to do so? If yes,
please support your answer with examples.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The hard hat softens any blow to the head. It resists and deflects the blow and distributes the impact over a large area.
