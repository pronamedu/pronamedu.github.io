Imagine being told you could not be an engineer or a truck driver, or even an airline pilot because 'girls don't do those jobs'. Imagine being told not to listen to that radio station because 'Bad Bay Elvis' and rock and roll music encouraged indecent behavior. Imagine putting on a tie or a hat and gloves to go out. These values and social conventions were generally accepted as 'correct' by parents of teenagers in the 1950s, and teenagers were not expected to question them. Before we complain about life in the 21st century we should look at how fortunate we are. Career choices for girls in the 1950s were mostly limited to becoming a hairdresser, nurse, or teacher, until they married. This would be unthinkable today. Women are having children in their late 30s not early 20s, and often their families are planned around their careers. In-co-educational schools girls often top the classes in Physics, Chemistry Technology, or Mathematics - traditionally scen as boys' subjccts. When the army recruitment officer visits, as many girls as boys are in the audience. Achieving your potential is no longer limited by your gender, and this must be a good thing. Another aspect of modern teenage life that reflects these immense social changes is in what is acceptable to wear. You might say that 'anything goes'. If you look at any group of teenagers wearing mufti you will see many different personal styles. One person has four or five body piercings, another has dreadlocked hair, the third shows off his boxers above his low-slung jeans; and 3​</a>

                        <p>Can I have five? These are my <strong>expectations</strong> for <strong>general mathematics subject</strong>:</p><p></p>I can think <strong>systematically</strong>, through regular and certain sequences. By learning mathematics, my brain is used to solving problems systematically. So that it is applied in real life, I can solve every problem more easily.My way of thinking becomes <strong>deductive</strong>. Conclusions are drawn from things that are general, not from things that are specific. So that I become spared from the interesting way of thinking by "coincidence".Learning mathematics trains me to be a more <strong>thorough, careful, and not careless</strong> as human being. I have to really pay attention to what the numbers are, how many zeros are after the comma, how the graph is, what about the intersection points and so on. If I am not careful in entering numbers, looking at graphs or doing calculations, of course it can lead to fatal consequences. The answers to the questions I got were wrong and sometimes very different from the actual answers.Teaches me to be <strong>patient in dealing with all things in life</strong>. When I work on math problems whose solutions are long and complicated, of course I have to work hard and not give up quickly. If something goes wrong, I try to research again from the beginning. Maybe there are wrong numbers, maybe there are wrong calculations. However, if later I can work on the problem, I really know how it feels, a sense of satisfaction and pride.<strong>No less important</strong>, there are actually many applications of mathematics in real life. Of course, in this world, calculating money, profit and loss, the problem of marketing goods, in engineering, even almost all the sciences in this world must touch the name of mathematics.<p>Mathematical skills is part of the life skills that I think we must have, especially in developing reasoning, communication, and problem solving faced in students' daily lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Let's learn about general mathematics subject here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/8260938?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
