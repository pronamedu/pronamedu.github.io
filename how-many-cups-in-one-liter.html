                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. 2700 ÷ 15 = 180. However, this is theoretical and assumes that no ribbon is destroyed when a cut is made.</p><p></p><p>2. The area of the land in square meters is 412, 500.
</p><p>
</p><p>500 pesos is the price per square meter of the land.
</p><p>
</p><p>Step-by-step explanation:
</p><p>
</p><p>Word Problem
</p><p>
</p><p>Since the first question asks for the area of the land in "square meter", we need to convert 0.75 kilometers to meters.
</p><p>
</p><p>Steps in Converting the Units
</p><p>
</p><p>Choose the appropriate conversion factors.
</p><p>
</p><p>Multiply the given unit measure by the conversion factor.
</p><p>
</p><p>Simplify the product.
</p><p>
</p><p>\begin{gathered}0.75\:\text{km}\times\left(\begin{aligned}\text{Conversion}\\\text{Factor}\end{aligned}\right)\end{gathered}
</p><p>
</p><p>0.75km×(
</p><p>
</p><p>Conversion
</p><p>
</p><p>Factor
</p><p>
</p><p>)
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, we know that 1 km = 1000 m, so our conversion factor should be \frac{1000\:\text{m}}{1\:\text{km}}
</p><p>
</p><p>1km
</p><p>
</p><p>1000m
</p><p>
</p><p>. We intended to have a unit km in the denominator so that during the multiplication process, we can cancel the km unit.
</p><p>
</p><p>\begin{gathered}\begin{aligned}0.75\:\text{km}\times\left(\frac{1000\:\text{m}}{1\:\text{km}}\right)&amp;=0.75\times 1000\:\text{m}\\&amp;=750\:\text{m}\end{aligned}\end{gathered}
</p><p>
</p><p>0.75km×(
</p><p>
</p><p>1km
</p><p>
</p><p>1000m
</p><p>
</p><p>)
</p><p>
</p><p>=0.75×1000m
</p><p>
</p><p>=750m
</p><p>
</p><p>The area of a rectangle is given by the formula, A = l \times wA=l×w . So, to solve for the area, substitute the value of l=750\:\text{m}l=750m and w=550\:\text{m}w=550m into the area formula then simplify.
</p><p>
</p><p>\begin{gathered}\begin{aligned}A&amp;=l\times w\\&amp;=750\:\text{m}\times550\:\text{m}\\&amp;=412, 500\:\text{m}^2\end{aligned}\end{gathered}
</p><p>
</p><p>A
</p><p>
</p><p>=l×w
</p><p>
</p><p>=750m×550m
</p><p>
</p><p>=412,500m
</p><p>
</p><p>2
</p><p>
</p><p>So, the area of the rectangular lot is 412, 500 square meters.
</p><p>
</p><p>If he is selling the whole land for 206, 250, 000 pesos, then to solve the price per square meter is given by the formula, C=\frac{\text{Price of the whole land}}{\text{Area of the whole land}}C=
</p><p>
</p><p>Area of the whole land
</p><p>
</p><p>Price of the whole land
</p><p>
</p><p>.
</p><p>
</p><p>So, to solve for the price per square meter, substitute the price of the whole land and the area of the whole land into the equation.
</p><p>
</p><p>\begin{gathered}\begin{aligned}C&amp;=\frac{206,250,000}{412,500}\\&amp;\boxed{C=500}\end{aligned}\end{gathered}
</p><p>
</p><p>C
</p><p>
</p><p>=
</p><p>
</p><p>412,500</p><p>206,250,000

Some studies have shown that the "normal" body temperature can have a wide range, from 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C). A temperature over 100.4°F (38°C) most often means you have a fever caused by an infection or illness.</p><p></p><p>5. 2.5 kg to grams is 2500
</p><p>
(n kg x 1000 = n g)

2500 ÷ 250 = 10

                            27. A pound of coffee beans makes 50 cups of coffee when brewed according to the instructions (4cups = 1 qt). How many liters of coffee can one kilogram of coffee beans produce?</h2><br />
                        KILOGRAM OF COFFEE BEANS<p>Since one pound of coffee beans <strong>makes 50 cups of coffee,</strong> we can calculate how many cups of coffee can be made from one kilogram of coffee beans as follows:</p><p></p><p>1 pound = 0.453592 kilograms</p><p>50 cups = 12.5 quarts = <strong>11.785 liters</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>So, one pound of coffee beans can make</strong><strong> 11.785 liters</strong><strong> of coffee.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>To find out </strong>how many liters of coffee can be made from one kilogram of coffee beans,<strong> we can use the following conversion:</strong></p><p>1 kilogram = 2.20462 pounds</p><p></p><p>Therefore, one kilogram of coffee beans can make:</p><p></p><p>(1 kilogram / 2.20462 pounds) * 11.785 liters = 5.3456 liters</p><p></p><p>So,<strong> one kilogram of coffee beans can make approximately 5.3456 liters of coffee</strong> when brewed according to the instructions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ANOTHER WAY TO SOLVE:</p>One pound of coffee beans produces 50 cups of coffee when brewed according to the instructions. We can use this information to determine how many cups of coffee one kilogram of coffee beans can produce.<p></p>First, we need to convert the weight of the coffee beans from pounds to kilograms. There are approximately 0.45 kilograms in one pound, so one kilogram of coffee beans is equivalent to approximately 2.2 pounds of coffee beans.<p></p>Now, we can use the<strong> ratio of 50 cups of coffee per pound of coffee beans</strong> to determine how many cups of coffee one kilogram of coffee beans can produce.<p></p>50 cups of coffee / 2.2 pounds of coffee beans = 22.73 cups of coffee per pound of coffee beans<p></p>Next, we need to convert cups to liters. According to the instructions, 4 cups of coffee is equivalent to 1 quart, and 1 quart is equivalent to 0.946 liters.<p></p><strong>22.73 cups of coffee / 4 cups per quart * 0.946 liters per quart = 12.91 liters of coffee</strong><p></p>Therefore, one kilogram of coffee beans can produce approximately 12.91 liters of coffee when brewed according to the instructions.<p></p><p><strong>Other references</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/15508719</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
