Do you think Mang Ambo will also harvest plenty of fruits and vegetables?a. Yesb. Noc. Never4. If you will buy the fruits and vegetables of Mang Ambo amounting to P200.00 Marked Price and you will be given a 20% discount, how much is the discount? Multiply the Marked Price of P200.00 by the Rate of Discount 20% or 0.20 to get the amount of discount.Follow the formula:​Marked Price X Rate of Discount = Amount of Discount​Answer: ____________________________5. What is the Selling Price of the fruits and vegetables if you will be given a 20% discount on the Marked Price of P200.00? Subtract the amount of discount from the Marked Price of P200.00 to get the Selling Price.Follow the formula:​Marked Price – Amount of Discount = Selling PriceAnswer: ___________________________​</h2><br />
