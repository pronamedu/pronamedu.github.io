So he barked loudly and sharply to frighten the cat. The cat was frightened by the size and strength of the dog. She then left the mouse to her enemy's care and walked quietly away.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One day, a cat accidentally found a mouse in a mouse trap. The cat was very happy for she did'nt have to hunt for her food for that day. She proudly walked towards the trap. The poor mouse cried so bitterly that she attracted the attention of the big dog. The dog came quickly. He pitied the little mouse.

The little mouse then gratefully thanked the dog and said smilingly, "Dear friend, someday I may be of use to you". Away went the dog looking glad he was able to help someone.     <br />       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />                             <br /> ➤ Comprehension Questions: </p><p><strong>1. Where do you think the story happened?</strong><br /><br />Based on the story, I think the setting here was on a house, because in the first line it says that the cat found a mouse trap, meaning that the cat was just trying to sneak up on some houses to find food, or like the cat was just walking through the streets and just happened to be barging up on this house, this house that put mouse trap on a place, their house's corner which a mouse was stuck on it. For some reason, mouse traps are often found on houses, obviously. <br /><br />I also have some last 2 reasons why I think that this occurred on a house, like when the little mouse cried painfully as the cat kind of takes it, as the mouse cries I think a dog was also passing by, (like what I thought about the cat thing) That the mouse got the dog's attention, which made him pity, and helped the little poor mouse.<br /><br />And, for my last reason, as the dog saves the mouse in the story it says that the cat left the mouse and walked quietly away, as I know the cat was kind of you know angry since the cat wasn't able to get it, just gives me a lot of things that turns out that yeah it occurred on a house... (also, when the dog went away this is also my reason)<br /><br /><br /><strong>2. Among the three animal characters, whom do you want to emulate?</strong><br /><br />Of course, the dog, the dog since it helped its fellow mate/animal whose in need and almost taking its life. The dog also showed his bravery towards the mouse.<br /></p><p><strong>3. What moral lesson have you learned from the story?​</strong><br />For me, I think the lesson here is help others even though you don't know or don't have a connection between them without expecting rewards, like help them with completely with your heart and mind because it's for their safety and of course for yours and helping others is the best choice instead of ignoring them because its that's what's good to you and to all the people. It also can be, "Always help others when they're in need."</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope this helps hehe, and good luck! :)</p><br />
