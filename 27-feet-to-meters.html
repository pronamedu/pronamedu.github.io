Find the diameter of the tank. Step 1: Read and understand the problem. Step 2: Devise a plan by illustrating the given problem and putting the appropriate labelling. Step 3: Carry out the plan by solving for the unknown. Step 4: Make a conclusion. score: 2. Dhar Naah has a circular garden that she separates into three equal parts.

Step 2: Devise a plan by illustrating the given problem and putting the appropriate labelling. Step 3: Carry out the plan by solving for the unknown. Step 4: Make a conclusion. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To find the diameter of the tank in the first problem, you can use the distance between Cardo and Alyana (27 feet) and the distance from Cardo to the tank (16 feet) to create a right triangle with the tank as the hypotenuse:</p><p></p><p>[asy]</p><p>unitsize(1 cm);</p><p>pair C, A, T;</p><p></p><p>C = (0,0);</p><p>A = (16,0);</p><p>T = (0,27);</p><p></p><p>draw(C--A--T--C);</p><p>draw(rightanglemark(C,A,T,15));</p><p></p><p>label("Cardo", C, S);</p><p>label("Alyana", A, S);</p><p>label("Tank", T, N);</p><p>label("16 ft", (C+A)/2, S);</p><p>label("27 ft", (C+T)/2, W);</p><p>[/asy]</p><p></p><p>Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse (the diameter of the tank) by solving for c:</p><p></p><p>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p><p>16^2 + 27^2 = c^2</p><p>256 + 729 = c^2</p><p>985 = c^2</p><p>c = √985</p><p>c ≈ 31.4 feet</p><p></p><p>So the diameter of the tank is approximately 31.4 feet.</p><p></p><p>For the second problem, the length of the arc of each part is equal to the circumference of the garden divided by 3. To find the circumference of the garden, we can use the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference, π is approximately 3.14, and r is the radius of the garden (9 meters). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:</p><p></p><p>C = 2πr</p><p>C = 2 * 3.14 * 9</p><p>C = 18.28 * 9</p><p>C = 164.52 meters</p><p></p><p>So the length of the arc of each part is 164.52 meters / 3 = 54.84 meters.</p><br />

We are given different values in either centimeters or inches, and are asked to convert them to either meters or feet. </p><p></p><p>To do this, we need to use the given scale and set up a proportion. For example, for the first problem (8 cm to meters), we know that 1 cm is equal to 15 meters according to the given scale. So, we can set up the proportion:</p><p></p><p>1 cm / 15 m = 8 cm / x</p><p></p><p>We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying:</p><p></p><p>1 cm * x = 15 m * 8 cm</p><p>x = (15 m * 8 cm) / 1 cm</p><p>x = 120 m</p><p></p><p>Therefore, 8 cm is equal to 120 meters.</p><p></p><p>For part C, we are given two volume problems. To find the volume of the auditorium, we use the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. We are given the values for l, w, and h, so we can simply substitute them into the formula and solve. </p><p></p><p>To find the volume of the box of milk, we use the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of one side.
