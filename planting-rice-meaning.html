Girls of the She Noun, take up the pestle-stones;Then we sing Shwe Nyaung and chant itmerrily in time,As gracefully as we pound away. 2What means that noise, that bustle we hear?Oh, a lady of the She Noun is giving alms,With the music of drums and gongs.3There is red-gold radiance over there;Perhaps the sun has risen.No, it’s the dyed robes of the monksOn their rounds with their begging bowls.Come fill them with alms – food! 4This Chicrkransia which I plantedIsn’t it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stemsBut if you pluck them before they flower,My plant will wither away, you know.5Hey there, maiden at the loom,What cloth are you weaving?Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?It’s cotton coverlet for me.</a>

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>1.How does the tittle "Ang pagpa-Milling means?How dou you know ? What is the textual evidence that supports your answer?</p><p>	I believe Ang Pagpa-milling means is a rotating tool that can help to mill the gold and the rice at the farm when it is harvest.The textual evidence is Ang kahirapan ng mahihirap because I believe the poem says how hard to be in the life of poverty. To find gold is dangerous and to plant rice is exhausted because sometimes it is lucky for you to harvest plenty of rice, often planting palay can not grow successfully and may fail because of various  causes and die.Additionally rice farming takes time to grow.</p><p>2.What is the setting of the poem? What is the textual evidence that supports your annwer?</p><p>	Farm and River. Because the poem says that gold is found “sa kasubaan “ which means river and the “humay” we can only found rice at the farm.</p><p>3. Is this source of income/living easy? Why or Why not? What stanza that shows the textual evidence that support your answer?</p><p>	 No, I’ve seen people in poverty working in finding gold and farm yet still suffering in poverty. The stanza that shows the textual evidence in my answer is “ ug ibaligya para ipalit sa bugas og sud-an” I believe that this words represent that people living in poverty their one priority is food to survive but when people are rich I believe they must say “to purchase what they want” or I rather say “ug ibaligya para ipalit sa akong mga gusto”.</p><p>4. How is pagpa-milling similar from the planting rice? What is the textual evidence that support your answer?</p><p>	Pagpa-milling is similar from the planting rice it is because rice need milling process to separate the some of husk ,bran layers  and to clean the rice.Just like the gold to find the gold we must do milling process because the gold may coverd by the sand.</p><p>5. What is the meaning of "dakong balay" in stanza 6?</p><p>	Malaking bahay gaya ng mansion. Ang Dakong balay ay isang historical marker. NHCP historical marker for the Don Florencio Noel House. But in other perspective of “dakong bahay” mean “ heaven”  because the last stanza also says “kay kini dili man pweding mag pirmi” which means our life is temporary and if we die we only know heaven and hell. “ kay ang dakong balay wala magtugot niini” for me  it means the  God know that you don’t  deserve to be in suffer. God is unfair just to test our Faith in him.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
