                                            Savy. The Friendliest Bee in a faraway place called Lala Land lived a swam of bees. Among the bees, Savy was the most by: Francisco N. Agull Jr. populor of all because of his friendliness. He greeted everybody with a smile. "Hi there! Hello!" Savy addressed almost everyone. "How are you doing he asked. Im happy to see you again, Savy" replied Devy. "Your smile made my day," she further said Savy was also a helpful bee. "Let me help you sip that honey." Savy said. Surel Thank you very much. I will easily finish my job," Livy answered. Aside from being helpful. Savy got an award from the Queen as the most obedient bee too. Guard our beehive tonight, Savy. the Queen commanded him. "Yes, I will my Queen Savy respectfully answered. However, among the bees, Chevy was the only one who was not convinced about savy's genuine friendliness. I don't think Savy is being true to everyone. I know he has motive to be the Queen's first soldier," he angrily said to himself. One day, while other bees were busy collecting nectar from flowers to flowers, Chevy was assigned that day to protect the beehive. A group of hive beetles attacked the beehive where Chevy served as the soldier of the day. "Hey, you little bee! Get out of our way! Give us your sweet honey!" the leader of the hive beetle shouted. Chevy was so scared that he didn't even move a bit. Savy saw the whole scenario. He immediately flew towards the hive beetles and with all his might, he stung them. "Ouch! What are you doing the enemies cowardly shouted. A swarm of bees quickly responded against the enemies. In a snap. the hive beetles escaped from the raging bees. "Can we talk for a minute, Savy?" asked Chevy. "Are you okay?" What is ite Tell me," replied Savy. "I'm sorry because all this time I have an ill feeling towards you," Chevy answered. "Huhe What did I do to hurt you" asked Savy. "Nothing, it is just that I envy you because everybody loves you," Chevy sadly replied. "That's alright. Don't worry, we can be friends!" From then on, Savy and Chevy became the closest friends ever. They were the friendliest bees in Lala Land,​</a>
