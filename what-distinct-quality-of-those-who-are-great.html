What legacy do great people leave behind them?</h2><br />
                        The Truly Great by Stephen Spender<p>The poem begins seeming like a praise to incredible individuals ever. As the main stanza grows, be that as it may, the speaker is by all accounts saying all the more regarding how significance is conceived of the association among ages and the association among humankind and nature.  </p><p>
The incredible ones recall the spirit's history, which means they comprehend the past. They have a noteworthy, possibly otherworldly, association with mankind's history and world history. The "interminable and singing" "halls of light" speak to the unending edification that is constantly accessible for human potential. The vitality of the world and the universe goes through that significance. Everything is associated.</p><p></p>Second stanza<p>The speaker laces thoughts of human life and the regular world. This proposes an inalienable association. There is something natural or harmonious about this. Note that in this stanza, the speaker cautions:</p><p></p>Never to allow gradually the traffic to smother
With noise and fog the flowering of the spirit.<p></p><p>The speaker is recommending that "traffic" (mechanical commotion and diversion) can upset the human/nature association. High-roller utilizes the "blossoming of the soul" representation to underscore this association between nature ("bloom") and the human "soul."  </p>  Last Stanza<p>The speaker exemplifies parts of nature, guaranteeing that they acclaim (fete) the incredible ones ever. In the last two lines, the speaker closes by portraying how the impact of extraordinary individuals is left in the "clear air." Their impact can be seen and recalled in human culture. High-roller closes with another idea of nature ("air"). It's as though to state their impact isn't just written in books, yet in addition in the common air itself.  </p><p>
</p><p>People are of the earth. Their vitality originates from the Sun. In this way, their significance is actually and idyllically connected to nature. Association is a significant subject here. The best ones recall the spirit's past. High-roller is demonstrating how they are associated with others crosswise over time and how they are associated with nature itself. It is an idealistic and cheerful sonnet since it is about human potential just as recorded, environmental, and profound association.</p><p></p><p>To know more about the poem:</p>https://brainly.ph/question/193056

                            17. i think continually of those who were truly great poem what distinct quality  of those who are great does the persona mention in first stanza?</h2><br />
                                   This poem, broadly, is an attempt to describe what makes a person 
"truly" great. The poem was written in the 1930's during wartime, this 
no doubt influenced the poet. However, soldiers are not the only people 
he is referring to. He is essentially referring to anyone who selflessly
 fights for what they believe in.<br /><br />The following is the first stanza of the poem " I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great" <br /><br />I think continually of those who were truly great.
 <br />Who, from the womb, remembered the soul’s history
 <br />Through corridors of light, where the hours are suns,<br /> Endless and singing.<br /> <br />

            

In the first stanza, the poet makes an important defining point in
the word "truly", it sets the theme for the rest of the poem which
expands upon this idea of truth showing what it is and how it effects the air
it touches. Another important word here is "continually", in my mind
something cannot be thought of continually without some form of prompting: this
prompting is his musing or concern over the men in the war.<br /><br /> 
          In the next few lines he defines artistically a characteristic he believes to
be endowed in men of true greatness, that of passion. He says that even before
birth these men are filled with passion and love ("soul's history"),
where they enjoy every moment in and "endless" indulgence in passion
and enjoyment ("singing"). In comparing them to a child in the
"womb", he endows these men or woman with a child's willingness to
participate or enjoy things: old and new.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
