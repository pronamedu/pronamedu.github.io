There is a certain proportion or appear­ance as in the ordinary printed or drawn letters which may be called normal or standard. The styles whose widths are less than these in propor­tion are called compressed or condensed, and those whose widths are greater are known as expanded or extended.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Engineering Lettering Lettering is an essential element in both traditional drawing and CAD drawing.

                        <p>General Proportions.—Before combining letters into words we must be familiar in detail with the forms and peculiarities of each letter. Letters vary in their proportion of width to height. Not only are the widths of the different letters in the same alphabet very unequal, but different alphabets vary in their "measure," some being tall and narrow, others short and wide. There is a certain proportion or appear­ance as in the ordinary printed or drawn letters which may be called normal or standard. The styles whose widths are less than these in propor­tion are called compressed or condensed, and those whose widths are greater are known as expanded or extended.</p><p></p><p>There is also in the different styles a wide variation in the proportion of the thickness of the stem or stroke of the letters to their height, ranging all the way from 1/3 to 1/16. Letters with heavy stems are called Bold Face or Black Face, and those with thin stems, Light Face.</p><p></p><p>There is an optical illusion well known to all design­ers, in which a horizontal line drawn across the middle of a rectangle appears to be below the middle. In order that the divisions may seem to be symmetrical such a line must be drawn above the middle. In the construction of letters this illusion must be provided for in what may be called the "rule of stability." In order to give the appearance of stability such letters as the B E K S X and Z, with the figures 3 and 8 must be drawn smaller at the top than the bottom. To see the effect of this illusion turn a printed page upside down and notice the letters mentioned.</p><br />
