Cook of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles discusses how he is especially concerned about climbing abortion rates. While visiting a Holocaust museum in 2016, he had a painful realization. He explains:</p><p></p><p>“It is believed that more than one million Jewish children were killed during the Holocaust.</p><p></p><p>“As I experienced the museum, I was overcome with emotion. Standing outside to regain my composure, I reflected on the horror of the experience and suddenly realized that in the United States alone, there are as many abortions every two years as the number of Jewish children killed in the Holocaust during the Second World War.</p><p></p><p>“The Jewish children were killed because they were Jews, and there is no analogue to this in all history, but the intensity of my feeling was about the loss of children.”</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what so many in the world believe and choose to do, every soul is priceless in our Heavenly Father’s eyes. Here are 10 eternal truths about just how valuable, precious, and irreplaceable each child of God is:</p><p></p><p>Genesis 1:26–28</p><p></p><p>Exodus 20:13</p><p></p><p>Psalm 127:3</p><p></p><p>Psalm 139:13–15</p><p></p><p>Jeremiah 1:5</p><p></p><p>Matthew 18:1–6</p><p></p><p>3 Nephi 17:21–24</p><p></p><p>Doctrine and Covenants 18:10</p><p></p><p>Doctrine and Covenants 132:19</p><p></p><p>Moses 1:39</p><p></p><p>Each life is truly a gift from God. We can honor His gift by cherishing our own lives as well as respecting and valuing the lives of others. We are precious in His sight, and by trusting Him and being diligent in our choices, we can share light and truth with the world of us.</p><p></p><p>correct me if I'm wrong don't judge me po tysm.</p><p></p><br />

                            28. Activity 1: The Bible says that because of LOVE, Jesus was the greatest gift given tomankind. Complete the verse below by referring to the Scriptures found in John 3:16 and todefine LOVE using the Scriptures found in 1 Corinthians 13.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1 Corinthians 13 1</p><p>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>John 3:16</p><p>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life. ... For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</p><br />

                            29. Create a short free verse poem with 8 lines and one stanza about the difference between direct and indirect speech​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Free verse poems do not follow the rules, and have no rhyme or rhythm; but they are still an artistic expression. They are sometimes thought to be a modern form of poetry; but, the free verse types of poem have been around for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>Following are several examples of free verse poems, including a few by Kelly Roper from our sister site LoveToKnow.com:</p><br />

                            30. What is the difference between Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture? How are the two often related to each other?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Sacred Scripture is something tangible and is contained in inspired sacred "books." Sacred Tradition is a living reality (CCC 80-83). Sacred Tradition is the Bible as received, meditated on, contemplated, read and put into effect in the life of the Church. <p></p><p></p><strong>How</strong><strong> </strong><strong>are</strong><strong> </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>two</strong><strong> </strong><strong>often</strong><strong> </strong><strong>relate</strong><strong>d</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>each</strong><strong> </strong><strong>other</strong><strong>?</strong><p></p><p><strong>Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound closely together, and communicate one with the other. For both of them, flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together in some fashion to form one thing, and move towards the same goal</strong><strong>.</strong></p><br />
