“Be proud of being a Filipino (even if it is not easy)” 
From INQUIRER.net / 04:50 PM June 12, 2015 
– Jen Denielle R. Hernandez, Grade 9 
What is the best the thing I have done for my country? I actually don’t know because at my age, it is impossible to do something big. Then I realized it isn’t 
important on how big it is. I think the best thing I’ve done for my country is to be proud that I am a Filipino. 
Being proud that I am a Filipino is not quite easy. Sometimes, I even doubt it because of our government. The people have to rally on the streets to get what they want. I feel like it is telling me that we have to go to war first before we can gain peace. When I was in Grade 7, we studied Philippine history. I then appreciated peace. It was not just about the Filipinos fighting the Spanish but how we fought for our independence. 
Now, if someone will ask me what is the best thing that I have done for our country, I will tell him or her that I am proud to be a Filipino. 
QUESTIONS: 
1. What is the best thing that the writer has done for the country? ________________________________________________________________ 
2. According to the writer, why is it impossible to do something big? ________________________________________________________________ 
3. What does “proud” mean?

4. Do you agree when she said that she is a proud Filipino?

“Be proud of being a Filipino (even if it is not easy)” 
From INQUIRER.net / 04:50 PM June 12, 2015 
– Jen Denielle R. Hernandez, Grade 9 
What is the best the thing I have done for my country? I actually don’t know because at my age, it is impossible to do something big. Then I realized it isn’t 
important on how big it is. I think the best thing I’ve done for my country is to be proud that I am a Filipino. 
Being proud that I am a Filipino is not quite easy. Sometimes, I even doubt it because of our government. The people have to rally on the streets to get what they want. I feel like it is telling me that we have to go to war first before we can gain peace. When I was in Grade 7, we studied Philippine history. I then appreciated peace. It was not just about the Filipinos fighting the Spanish but how we fought for our independence. 
Now, if someone will ask me what is the best thing that I have done for our country, I will tell him or her that I am proud to be a Filipino.
