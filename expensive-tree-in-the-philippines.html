                                            After driving through a stretch of eerie darkness, the mansion at the end of the winding driveway is an illuminating sight. Lights spotlight the colonial facade and the brick wall leading to an open patio that fans out into the front door. A leaning tree shelters the edge of the patio. On the right side of the wide foyer is the edge of the living room, a rectangular expense under a high ceiling. The dining room runs parallel to the entire length of a living room. This divides into conversation groupings furniture done in satin beige and peach with draperies to match. The thick rugs mute footsteps on the black marble floors.
