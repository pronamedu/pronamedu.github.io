I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.There are things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.At breakfast, I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, "Goodbye, Daddy!" and I frowned, and said in reply, "Hold your shoulders back!"Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road, I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles There were holes in your stockings I humiliated you before you boyfriends by marching you shead of me to the house Stockings were expensive - and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that son from a father!Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door "What is it you want?" I snapped. You said nothing but ran across in one tempestuous plunge and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither And then you were gone, pattering up the stairsWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you it was that I expected too much of youth I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own yearsAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character The little heart of you was as big asthe dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good nightNothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there ashamed!It is a feeble atonement, i know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer and laugh when you laugh I will bite my tongue when impatient words come I will keep saying as if it were a ritual "He is nothing buy a boy - a little boy!"am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her shoulder I have asked too much, too much.1.What is the biggest regret of the father in the story?2.In your own opinion, why Father Forgets was the title of the story?​​</a>

                                            interpret by using the elements of a short story                The Diary of the Girl Dear Diary.          It was a very cold winter when the breath of the light of home was taken back by the Giver of life. I was out in the dark during that time. The moon keeps on smiling but suddenly it cried. I have cried out so loud from the envelope of love and caress. At the same time, the deafening silence of the great woman cornered the four sides of the white room. Together with the men and women in white, is the pillar of home. Yes, he was left alone, just with me, with that day of tears, sorrow and melancholy. But he, knowing I am the cause of the decease of his dearly love, his flower of delight since high school of loyalty and honesty, with love and tenderness, with sacrifice and devotion, he poses that smile of inspiring and motivating love as I was going out of the school. It seems he always misses me after eight hours stay inside that highly-cost home of human knowledge and wisdom. He holds and carries me in his strong arms as he turns me once or twice around. He kisses me with his beard that tickles my thin skin. But the feeling is different. I love it. Yes, he was left alone with only a piece of land inherited from his deceased parents (which was sold when I was out to light) since my mom's family defied him for his indigence and misfortune. He was alone. He works nine or ten hours a day in that factory of not-so-popular cloth trade. His pay is just a little. However, his money is like abundant leaves. I was wondering how he pays our rent, our water, our food, my ice cream, my Barbie, my tiny thick uniform, my candies, my chocolates and my pretty toys. Sometimes, I ask the air, "Where on earth my dad get lots of money?" Isn't it surprising? Yes it is. It is really surprising that my dad pretends to be happy though I am the cause of his heartaches when mom died. Yes he is rich because he pretends to be someone because he wants me to be happy at all times. He pretends not to be tired because he wants me to be good at school. He makes me laugh because he does not want me to be lonely. And most of all, he wants me to smile because when I do, his pain will go away. Sometimes, he holds his stomach. I know it is empty for the whole day. How I wish that time must fly so fast so I could accompany him to bear his burdens. I knew it then. I knew that his joy is me. He sacrifices, he lies and he pretends because I am the only fruit of his sweet long love from the great woman whom I owe my life- my mom. How touching for a little girl like me with five and four years in this world! Though innocent, I feel the warm caress and tender touch, sweetest smile and eyes so bright of my dad. This is Sharina, leaving you of the greetings, "Happy Father's Day! Love your dad unconditionally!"​</a>

                                            Task 3. Blind Perspective You will read a folktale from India about six blind men who wanted to learn about a certain kind of animal, each touching its different parts, and disagreeing with their findings. Can you guess what the animal is? There were once six blind men who stood by the roadside every day and begged from the people who passed. They had often heard of __________, but they had never seen one; for, being blind, how could they? It so happened one morning that an __________ was driven down the road where they stood. When they were told that the great beast was before them, they asked the driver to let him stop so that they might see him. Of course, they could not see him with their eyes; but they thought that by touching him they could learn just what kind of animal he was. The first one happened to put his hand on the __________ side. "Well, well!" he said, "now I know all about this beast. He is exactly like a wall." The second felt only of the __________ tusk. "My brother," he said, "you are mistaken. He is not at all like a wall. He is round and smooth and sharp. He is more like a spear than anything else." The third happened to take hold of the __________ trunk. "Both of you are wrong," he said. "Anybody who knows anything can see that this __________ is like a snake." The fourth reached out his arms and grasped one of the __________ legs. "Oh, how blind you are!" he said. "It is very plain to me that he is round and tall like a tree."​</a>

Encircle the letter of the correct answer if there are choices.Why does a cow chewing when she isn’t eating?		A cow has a special stomach with four parts.  When she eats grass, she chews it just enough to make it wet.  Then it goes into the first part of her stomach, where it becomes softer.  From there it goes into the second part, where it is made into little balls called “cuds”.  Later, while the cow is resting, she brings up each cud one at a time and chews it well.  When she swallows it, the food goes into the third part of her stomach.  There the water is squeezed out of it.  Finally, the food goes to the fourth part of the cow’s stomach and is broken down into very tiny pieces.  Then the cow’s body can take what it needs from the food to live and grow.1.

                                            MAKING CONNECTIONS STOP BUGGING ME SALL Jerry and Andy were two little ants who were best of friends. They spent their days helping out the colony, working hard to collect food and bring it back into their ant hill. They loved playing games in their spare time. One day the boys had an argument. Jerry was playing with another ant called Peter and Andy got jealous. He ran over to Jerry and told him he couldn't play with anyone else. Jerry didn't like being told what to do so he ignored Andy and kept on playing with Peter. Andy got very upset. He had been friends with Jerry a long time and now Jerry didn't want to play with him. So Andy decided to walk home by himself, feeling lonely and sad. He was so upset that he wasn't looking where he was going and suddenly he fell into a huge puddle! Andy didn't know how to swim and he quickly started sinking to the bottom of the water. Peter saw that Andy was in trouble and ran over to save him, with Jerry following close behind. He found a stick and held it out into the water for Andy to grab hold of. He pulled Andy out of the water! From that day on the three ants became best of friends, and Jerry never got jealous again.

L MAKING CONNECTIONS PLUS ONE MAKES FOUR Something very exciting is happening today. I'm getting a new little baby sister or baby brother. My parents went to the hospital yesterday and now I get to and see them and meet my new sibling. My aunty drives me to the hospital and we go to my parents' room. I walk in and I see an adorable little baby in my mother's arms. My Mum says to me "Would you like to hold her?" I'm so excited. Of course I want to hold my new baby sister! The nurse places her gently in my arms and I hold her close to me. She looks just like a little doll, fast asleep in my arms. Of course, it doesn't take long for her to start screaming! I look around, panicking. I have absolutely no clue what to do with a screaming baby. The nurse takes her from my arms and passes her carefully to my mother. The baby's loud screams become a quiet whimper as my mum rocks her gently. I can't believe I'm now a big brother! The next day my parents bring my little sister, Isabelle, home from the hospital. She has her own room, called a nursery, next to mine. It has a crib, a changing table and lots of little toys for her to play with. I can't wait to be able to play games with her when she gets a bit older! MAKE TWO CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TEXT AND YOUR OWN LIFE. 1. 2. 1. 2. Name 2.

 “A borrowed book is like a guest in the house; it must be treated with punctiliousness, with a
 certain considerate formality. You must see that it sustains no damage; it must not suffer while under your roof. You cannot leave it carelessly, you cannot mark it, you cannot turn down the
 pages, you cannot use it familiarly. And then, someday, although this is seldom done, you really
 ought to return it.” _______________________________________________________

 3.” I am come amongst you, as you see, at this time, not for my recreation and disport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of the battle, to live and die amongst you all; to lay down for my God, and for my kingdom, and my people, my honor and my blood, even in the dust. I know I
 have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should
 dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonor shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your
 virtues in the field.”_______________________________________________

“we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall
 fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by
 the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its
 power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.”
 “In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in history, I send to every household of my peoples,
 both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.”</a>

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.There are things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.At breakfast, I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, "Goodbye, Daddy!" and I frowned, and said in reply, "Hold your shoulders back!"Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road, I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles There were holes in your stockings I humiliated you before you boyfriends by marching you shead of me to the house Stockings were expensive - and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that son from a father!Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door "What is it you want?" I snapped. You said nothing but ran across in one tempestuous plunge and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither And then you were gone, pattering up the stairsWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you it was that I expected too much of youth I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own yearsAnd there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character The little heart of you was as big asthe dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good nightNothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there ashamed!It is a feeble atonement, i know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer and laugh when you laugh I will bite my tongue when impatient words come I will keep saying as if it were a ritual "He is nothing buy a boy - a little boy!"am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her shoulder I have asked too much, too much.1.What is the biggest regret of the father in the story?2.In your own opinion, why Father Forgets was the title of the story?​​</h2><br />

                            6. interpret by using the elements of a short story                The Diary of the Girl Dear Diary.          It was a very cold winter when the breath of the light of home was taken back by the Giver of life. I was out in the dark during that time. The moon keeps on smiling but suddenly it cried. I have cried out so loud from the envelope of love and caress. At the same time, the deafening silence of the great woman cornered the four sides of the white room. Together with the men and women in white, is the pillar of home. Yes, he was left alone, just with me, with that day of tears, sorrow and melancholy. But he, knowing I am the cause of the decease of his dearly love, his flower of delight since high school of loyalty and honesty, with love and tenderness, with sacrifice and devotion, he poses that smile of inspiring and motivating love as I was going out of the school. It seems he always misses me after eight hours stay inside that highly-cost home of human knowledge and wisdom. He holds and carries me in his strong arms as he turns me once or twice around. He kisses me with his beard that tickles my thin skin. But the feeling is different. I love it. Yes, he was left alone with only a piece of land inherited from his deceased parents (which was sold when I was out to light) since my mom's family defied him for his indigence and misfortune. He was alone. He works nine or ten hours a day in that factory of not-so-popular cloth trade. His pay is just a little. However, his money is like abundant leaves. I was wondering how he pays our rent, our water, our food, my ice cream, my Barbie, my tiny thick uniform, my candies, my chocolates and my pretty toys. Sometimes, I ask the air, "Where on earth my dad get lots of money?" Isn't it surprising? Yes it is. It is really surprising that my dad pretends to be happy though I am the cause of his heartaches when mom died. Yes he is rich because he pretends to be someone because he wants me to be happy at all times. He pretends not to be tired because he wants me to be good at school. He makes me laugh because he does not want me to be lonely. And most of all, he wants me to smile because when I do, his pain will go away. Sometimes, he holds his stomach. I know it is empty for the whole day. How I wish that time must fly so fast so I could accompany him to bear his burdens. I knew it then. I knew that his joy is me. He sacrifices, he lies and he pretends because I am the only fruit of his sweet long love from the great woman whom I owe my life- my mom. How touching for a little girl like me with five and four years in this world! Though innocent, I feel the warm caress and tender touch, sweetest smile and eyes so bright of my dad. This is Sharina, leaving you of the greetings, "Happy Father's Day! Love your dad unconditionally!"​</h2><br />

Blind Perspective You will read a folktale from India about six blind men who wanted to learn about a certain kind of animal, each touching its different parts, and disagreeing with their findings. Can you guess what the animal is? There were once six blind men who stood by the roadside every day and begged from the people who passed. They had often heard of __________, but they had never seen one; for, being blind, how could they? It so happened one morning that an __________ was driven down the road where they stood. When they were told that the great beast was before them, they asked the driver to let him stop so that they might see him. Of course, they could not see him with their eyes; but they thought that by touching him they could learn just what kind of animal he was. The first one happened to put his hand on the __________ side. "Well, well!" he said, "now I know all about this beast. He is exactly like a wall." The second felt only of the __________ tusk. "My brother," he said, "you are mistaken. He is not at all like a wall. He is round and smooth and sharp. He is more like a spear than anything else." The third happened to take hold of the __________ trunk. "Both of you are wrong," he said. "Anybody who knows anything can see that this __________ is like a snake." The fourth reached out his arms and grasped one of the __________ legs. "Oh, how blind you are!" he said. "It is very plain to me that he is round and tall like a tree."​</h2><br />

Encircle the letter of the correct answer if there are choices.Why does a cow chewing when she isn’t eating?		A cow has a special stomach with four parts.  When she eats grass, she chews it just enough to make it wet.  Then it goes into the first part of her stomach, where it becomes softer.  From there it goes into the second part, where it is made into little balls called “cuds”.  Later, while the cow is resting, she brings up each cud one at a time and chews it well.  When she swallows it, the food goes into the third part of her stomach.  There the water is squeezed out of it.  Finally, the food goes to the fourth part of the cow’s stomach and is broken down into very tiny pieces.  Then the cow’s body can take what it needs from the food to live and grow.1.

                            11. MAKING CONNECTIONS STOP BUGGING ME SALL Jerry and Andy were two little ants who were best of friends. They spent their days helping out the colony, working hard to collect food and bring it back into their ant hill. They loved playing games in their spare time. One day the boys had an argument. Jerry was playing with another ant called Peter and Andy got jealous. He ran over to Jerry and told him he couldn't play with anyone else. Jerry didn't like being told what to do so he ignored Andy and kept on playing with Peter. Andy got very upset. He had been friends with Jerry a long time and now Jerry didn't want to play with him. So Andy decided to walk home by himself, feeling lonely and sad. He was so upset that he wasn't looking where he was going and suddenly he fell into a huge puddle! Andy didn't know how to swim and he quickly started sinking to the bottom of the water. Peter saw that Andy was in trouble and ran over to save him, with Jerry following close behind. He found a stick and held it out into the water for Andy to grab hold of. He pulled Andy out of the water! From that day on the three ants became best of friends, and Jerry never got jealous again.

My parents went to the hospital yesterday and now I get to and see them and meet my new sibling. My aunty drives me to the hospital and we go to my parents' room. I walk in and I see an adorable little baby in my mother's arms. My Mum says to me "Would you like to hold her?" I'm so excited. Of course I want to hold my new baby sister! The nurse places her gently in my arms and I hold her close to me. She looks just like a little doll, fast asleep in my arms. Of course, it doesn't take long for her to start screaming! I look around, panicking. I have absolutely no clue what to do with a screaming baby. The nurse takes her from my arms and passes her carefully to my mother. The baby's loud screams become a quiet whimper as my mum rocks her gently. I can't believe I'm now a big brother! The next day my parents bring my little sister, Isabelle, home from the hospital. She has her own room, called a nursery, next to mine. It has a crib, a changing table and lots of little toys for her to play with. I can't wait to be able to play games with her when she gets a bit older! MAKE TWO CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TEXT AND YOUR OWN LIFE. 1. 2. 1. 2. Name 2.

                            16. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.
