                                            HOMEOSTASIS
There are two body systems which are important in enabling the body to maintain homeostasis.
They are 1.________
and 2________
Of all the 3_______
the nervous system is the major control system of homeostasis. It
provides monitoring, response, and 4._______
of all systems in the human body and other
organisms. It functions from the tiny level of individual cells to affecting the whole body at once.
Receptors inside and outside the body are constantly monitoring conditions and watching for
5.____________
When a body system leaves a set point and falls outside its normal range, signals
are sent through the nervous system which trigger responses to bring the system back into the
normal range of functioning. This is the process of homeostasis. These complicated and intricate
processes have evolved over millions of years. For example, thermoreceptors and mechanoreceptors
in the skin sense changes in temperature and pressure, respectively. Then, signals sent from them
to the 6._________
make it possible to detect situations that could cause injury or death. In addition,
nerves make muscles contract which moves the bones of the skeleton, making it possible to evade
predators and/or fight. This ability to perceive the environment and reacting to it is critical to
maintaining homeostasis in the body. Most body systems maintain homeostasis by using
7.____________
which is maybe positive and negative. Positive feedback occurs
when the response to a stimulus 8.________

clotting. When a wound causes bleeding, the body responds with a positive feedback loop to clot
the blood and stop blood loss. Negative feedback occurs when the response to a stimulus

the original stimulus. It is most common for homeostasis. An example is the
regulation of blood glucose level. If the blood glucose level increases beyond the normal range,
more glucose is absorbed in the intestine and stored in the form of glycogen in the liver. The
conversion and conservation are controlled by the release of 10._________
from the
pancreas. The hormone insulin stimulates the muscles and liver to uptake the glucose. If the blood
glucose level decreases and more glucose is required in the blood, the release of insulin is inhibited,
reducing the absorption of blood glucose.</a>

For example, a 2019 study of more than 6,500 12 to 15 years olds in the United States found that those who spent more than three hours a day using social media might be at heightened risk for mental health problems. Another 2019 study of more than 12,000 13 to 16 year olds in England found that social media more than three times a day predicted poor mental health and well-being in teens. Finally, a study of more than 450 teens found that greater social media use worsens their sleep quality and raises their levels of anxiety and depression.1. What is the point?2.

In 2015, it was recorded that around 34% of the population were not married. A researcher surveyed a random sample of 500 couples. He found out that 18% of them were living together but unmarried. Test at 5% significance level that the current percentage of unmarried couples is different from 34%. ANSWER: Between the acceptance region 2. An average construction worker hourly rate pay in the Philippines is Php 62.50 with a standard deviation of Php 6.01. A random sample of 20 manufacturing workers were asked on their hourly rate and found out that they had an average of Php 50.00 hourly rate pay with a standard deviation of Php 5.00. Construct a 90% confidence interval that the average hourly rate for construction workers is higher than the average hourly rate for manufacturing workers. 3. A chemist invented an additive to increase the lifespan of rechargeable battery. The said additive will extend on average the battery's lifespan to 48 months. Test the hypothesis at 0.01% level of significance that the average lifespan is higher than 48 months. 4. The average number of years to finish basic education is 14. A sample of 30 senior high school students were asked and found out that the mean number of years to finish their basic education is 12 with a standard deviation of 2 years. Test the hypothesis at 93% confidence interval that the average number of years to finish basic education is less than 14 years. 5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many currently available drugs show unfavourable physicochemical properties for delivery into or across the skin and temporary chemical modulation of the penetrant is one option to achieve improved delivery properties. Pro-drugs are chemical derivatives of an active drug which is covalently bonded to an inactive pro-moiety in order to overcome pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic barriers. A pro-drug relies upon conversion within the body to release the parent active drug (and pro-moiety) to elicit its pharmacological effect. The main drawback of this approach is that the pro-moiety is essentially an unwanted ballast which, when released, can lead to adverse effects. The term 'co-drug' refers to two or more therapeutic compounds active against the same disease bonded via a covalent chemical linkage and it is this approach which is reviewed for the first time in the current article. For topically applied co-drugs, each moiety is liberated in situ, either chemically or enzymatically, once the stratum corneum barrier has been overcome by the co-drug. Advantages include synergistic modulation of the disease process, enhancement of drug delivery and pharmacokinetic properties and the potential to enhance stability by masking of labile functional groups. The amount of published work on co-drugs is limited but the available data suggest the co-drug concept could provide a significant therapeutic improvement in dermatological diseases. However, the applicability of the co-drug approach is subject to strict limitations pertaining mainly to the availability of compatible moieties and physicochemical properties of the overall molecule.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>i i hope i can help </p><p></p><br />

                            17. HOMEOSTASIS
There are two body systems which are important in enabling the body to maintain homeostasis.
They are 1.________
and 2________
Of all the 3_______
the nervous system is the major control system of homeostasis. It
provides monitoring, response, and 4._______
of all systems in the human body and other
organisms. It functions from the tiny level of individual cells to affecting the whole body at once.
Receptors inside and outside the body are constantly monitoring conditions and watching for
5.____________
When a body system leaves a set point and falls outside its normal range, signals
are sent through the nervous system which trigger responses to bring the system back into the
normal range of functioning. This is the process of homeostasis. These complicated and intricate
processes have evolved over millions of years. For example, thermoreceptors and mechanoreceptors
in the skin sense changes in temperature and pressure, respectively. Then, signals sent from them
to the 6._________
make it possible to detect situations that could cause injury or death. In addition,
nerves make muscles contract which moves the bones of the skeleton, making it possible to evade
predators and/or fight. This ability to perceive the environment and reacting to it is critical to
maintaining homeostasis in the body. Most body systems maintain homeostasis by using
7.____________
which is maybe positive and negative. Positive feedback occurs
when the response to a stimulus 8.________

clotting. When a wound causes bleeding, the body responds with a positive feedback loop to clot
the blood and stop blood loss. Negative feedback occurs when the response to a stimulus

the original stimulus. It is most common for homeostasis. An example is the
regulation of blood glucose level. If the blood glucose level increases beyond the normal range,
more glucose is absorbed in the intestine and stored in the form of glycogen in the liver. The
conversion and conservation are controlled by the release of 10._________
from the
pancreas. The hormone insulin stimulates the muscles and liver to uptake the glucose. If the blood
glucose level decreases and more glucose is required in the blood, the release of insulin is inhibited,
reducing the absorption of blood glucose.</h2><br />

                            24. Directions: Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow. Social media negatively affects teens, especially those who use it for long hours. For example, a 2019 study of more than 6,500 12 to 15 years olds in the United States found that those who spent more than three hours a day using social media might be at heightened risk for mental health problems. Another 2019 study of more than 12,000 13 to 16 year olds in England found that social media more than three times a day predicted poor mental health and well-being in teens. Finally, a study of more than 450 teens found that greater social media use worsens their sleep quality and raises their levels of anxiety and depression.1. What is the point?2. What are the evidences that support the point?3. Are the evidences sufficient?4. Are the evidences relevant? 5. Are the evidences representative? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The point is that social media has a negative impact on teenagers, especially those who spend a long time using it.The evidences that support the point are three studies conducted in 2019. The first study involved more than 6,500 12 to 15-year-olds in the United States and found that those who spent more than three hours a day on social media may be at heightened risk for mental health problems. The second study involved more than 12,000 13 to 16-year-olds in England and found that using social media more than three times a day predicted poor mental health and well-being in teens. The third study involved more than 450 teens and found that greater social media use worsened their sleep quality and raised their levels of anxiety and depression.The evidences presented are limited to only three studies and were conducted in 2019. While the studies provide some support for the point, they may not be sufficient to make a definitive conclusion. Additional research is needed to confirm the findings and to explore the possible causes of the negative impact.The evidences appear to be relevant as all three studies focused on the impact of social media use on teenagers' mental health and well-being.It is unclear whether the evidences are representative as the studies involved different sample sizes, age ranges, and geographic locations. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize the findings to all teenagers. Further research with more diverse and representative samples may be needed to draw more conclusive findings.<br />

                            29. Activity A. "My Personal Changes" 1. What changes did you notice about yourself when you were still 7 to 9 years old and when you reached 10-12 years old. Write your observations on the boxes. CHANGES EXPERIENCED 7 to 9 years old 10-12 years old Example: Height I stand on a chair while getting something from the highest level of our cabinet I can now get things from the highest level of our cabinet without the aid of a chair. 1. Height 2. Weight 3. Hips 4. Shoulders 5. Breast 6. Armpit 7. Adam's apple 8. genitals 9. muscles and bones 10. voice 2. How did you feel about the physical changes you experienced? 3. To whom did you tell or share these experiences?my armpit what are the changes 7-9 years old, 10-12 years old​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer for #1:</strong><p>1). Height. When we were younger we used to go up a chair to get something from the table and now we do not need it anymore since our height is enough to reach something from the table..</p><p></p><p>2). Weight. We gain weight because of our bones the more we get older the more bigger and heavier our bones will get.</p><p></p><p>3). Hips. As we age, our hips will be more round than the previous.</p><p></p><p>4). Shoulders. As we age our shoulders gets more broad or wide.</p><p></p><p>5). Breast. For women, our breast gets bigger because it grows in response to the hormones estrogen and progesterone. As you enter puberty, levels of these hormones increase. Your breasts begin to grow under the stimulation of these hormones.</p><p></p><p>6). Armpits. For men, hair grows from their armpits because it  prevents skin-to-skin contact when doing certain activities, such as running and walking.</p><p></p><p>7). Adam's Apple. As I said in number 3, the older we get the more bigger and heavier our bones will get. People may say that women does not have any Adam's Apple but all of us really has. Its just that men's Adam's Apple is bigger than ours.</p><p></p><p>8). Genitals. Our genitals will get more bigger and it will also grow hair, Pubic hair is its ability to reduce friction during sexual intercourse. It can also stop bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body.</p><p></p><p>9). Muscles and Bones. As we age, our bones tend to get bigger, heavier, and stronger. But when we are on our 50's or 60's our bones will get weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>10). Voice. Before we reach puberty, our larynx is pretty small and your vocal cords are kind of small and thin. And when we are now going through puberty, the larynx gets bigger and the vocal cords lengthen and thicken, so your voice gets deeper.</p><p></p><strong>Answer for #2 - 3:</strong><p>2). I feel matured and new.</p><p></p><p>3). To no one, because puberty or physical change is not some kind of topic that we should talk about with anyone.</p><br />
