                                            Let's Explore This Suggested Time Allotment: 20 Minutes Activity 1: Directions: The following situations depict some work values. Choose two (2) situations and read them carefully. Write your insights on a clean sheet of paper. And answer the processing questions thereafter. Situation 1 The teacher asked her learners to bring materials for the slogan making contest. This will be their output for the end of 2nd quarter. Owen brought his own materials, the same with Brett and Rozlin. But Aiza forgot to bring hers. She decided to borrow materials from Nicole. Willingly, Nicole and Brett lent their materials to her. Not only they wrote the slogan but also added colorful designs and artworks to make it more appealing to the eyes. The teacher marked their works with "Very Good". Situation 2 There will be a Science Quiz Bee for the Grade 10. The adviser asked her five (5) learners to join. Donna and Laurice invited their co-participants in their class to conduct group review so that they will be prepared for the event. Everyone participated and did their best during the contest. Donna won first place followed by Laurice. Situation 3 Due to the lack of classrooms, learners are congested in their class. To resolve the problem, the principal divided the class into 2. Half the class will have their session in the morning as early as 6 o'clock and the other half in the afternoon. Yannah lived far from the school. She finds it difficult to meet the call time aside from the fact that she is also selling vegetables in the market after school. So, she wakes up early every morning so as not to miss classes and adjust her schedule to attend her work. At night, she still manages to do her homework so that she can be ready in class the next day. Situation 4 Learners were instructed to choose their field of specialization in their Technology Livelihood Education (TLE) class. Rona, Joselie, and Mavic enrolled in an electrical installation course while Efren, Enrique, and Floro decided to register in dressmaking class. Their teacher accepted these learners and treated them equally.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Bretton Woods Agreement was negotiated in July 1944 by delegates from 44 countries at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. Thus, the name “Bretton Woods Agreement.  Under the Bretton Woods System, gold was the basis for the U.S. dollar, and other currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar’s value. The Bretton Woods System effectively came to an end in the early 1970s when President Richard M. Nixon announced that the U.S. would no longer exchange gold for U.S. currency.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS YOU :) PA BRAINLIEST NA RIN PO</p><br />

                            9. Let's Explore This Suggested Time Allotment: 20 Minutes Activity 1: Directions: The following situations depict some work values. Choose two (2) situations and read them carefully. Write your insights on a clean sheet of paper. And answer the processing questions thereafter. Situation 1 The teacher asked her learners to bring materials for the slogan making contest. This will be their output for the end of 2nd quarter. Owen brought his own materials, the same with Brett and Rozlin. But Aiza forgot to bring hers. She decided to borrow materials from Nicole. Willingly, Nicole and Brett lent their materials to her. Not only they wrote the slogan but also added colorful designs and artworks to make it more appealing to the eyes. The teacher marked their works with "Very Good". Situation 2 There will be a Science Quiz Bee for the Grade 10. The adviser asked her five (5) learners to join. Donna and Laurice invited their co-participants in their class to conduct group review so that they will be prepared for the event. Everyone participated and did their best during the contest. Donna won first place followed by Laurice. Situation 3 Due to the lack of classrooms, learners are congested in their class. To resolve the problem, the principal divided the class into 2. Half the class will have their session in the morning as early as 6 o'clock and the other half in the afternoon. Yannah lived far from the school. She finds it difficult to meet the call time aside from the fact that she is also selling vegetables in the market after school. So, she wakes up early every morning so as not to miss classes and adjust her schedule to attend her work. At night, she still manages to do her homework so that she can be ready in class the next day. Situation 4 Learners were instructed to choose their field of specialization in their Technology Livelihood Education (TLE) class. Rona, Joselie, and Mavic enrolled in an electrical installation course while Efren, Enrique, and Floro decided to register in dressmaking class. Their teacher accepted these learners and treated them equally.​</h2><br />
