It does not have a body. The numbers on each face sums up to 21 and are referred as eyes but you cannot see
What is inanimate, yet can stand up,
Can start out copper and end up as steel,
So fragile, a child could break one,
But many have the strength to lift a man?

                                            “Three Sons and a Bundle of Sticks” Once upon a time, an old man lived with his three sons in a village. The three sons were hard workers. Still, they quarreled all the time. The old man tried a lot to unite them but he failed. Though the villagers appreciated their hard work and efforts, they made fun of them on their fights. Months passed by and the old man fell sick. He told his sons to stay united, but they didn’t listen to him, So he decided to teach them a practical lesson so that they would forget their differences and stay united.The old man called his sons. He told them, “ I will give you a bundle of sticks. Separate each stick and you will have to break each stick into two. The one who breaks the sticks quickly will be rewarded more”. The sons agreed. The old man gave a bundle of ten sticks to each of them and asked them to break each stick into two pieces. They broke the sticks into pieces in minutes. And again they started to quarrel among themselves who came first. The old man said, “ Dear sons, the game is not over. Now I will give another bundle of sticks to each of you. You will have to break the sticks as a bundle, not as separate sticks.” The sons agreed and tried to break the bundle of sticks. Though they tried their best, they could not break the bundle. They failed to complete the task. The three sons reported their failure to their father. The old man replied, “Dear sons, see! You could easily break the single sticks into pieces, but you were not able to break the bundle! So if you stay united, nobody can do any harm to you. If you quarrel every time with your brothers, anyone can easily defeat you. I request you to stay united.” The three sons understood the power of unity and promised their father that whatever be the situation, they would all stay together.QUESTIONS;1.

                                            World War XII, as everyone knows, brought about the collapse of civilization, Towns, cities, and villages disappeared. All the groves and forests were destroyed, and all the gardens, and all the works of art. Men, women, and children became lower than the animals. Discouraged and disillusioned, dogs deserted their fallen masters. Books, paintings and music disappeared from the earth, and human beings just sat around doing nothing. Years went by. Even the few generals who were left forgot what the last war had decided. Boys and girls grew up to stare at each other blankly. Love had passed from the Earth. One day, a young girl who had never seen a flower chanced to come upon the last one in the world. She told the other human beings that the last flower was dying. The only one who paid any attention to her was a young man. Together, the young man and the girl nurtured the flower and it began to live again. One day, a bee visited the flower, and a hummingbird. Before long, there were two flowers, and then a great many. Groves and forests flourished again. The young girl began to take interest in how she looked. The young man discovered that touching the girl was pleasurable. Love was reborn into. the world. The children of the young man and the girl grew up strong and healthy. They learned to run and laugh. Dogs came out of their exile. The young man discovered how to build a shelter. Pretty soon everybody was building shelters. Towns, cities, and villages sprung up. Song came back into the world, and troubadours and jugglers, tailors and cobblers, painters and poets and sculptors, and soldiers and Lieutenants and Captains, and Generals and Major Generals, and liberators. Some people went to one place to live, and some to another. Before long, those who went to the valleys wished they had gone to live in the hills. And those who had to live in the hills wished they had gone to live in the valleys. The liberators, under the guidance of God, set fire to the discontented. So presently, the world was at war again. This time, the destruction was so complete that nothing at all was left in the world, except one man, one woman, and one flower.B.Discuss the following questions1.

The poem "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost is about the __________
that one makes in life. It tells about a man who comes to a ___________ in the
road he is travelling upon. He feels ___________ that he cannot
travel___________ paths as he must choose one. Frost uses this fork in the road
to represent a point in the man's life where he has to choose the ___________
he wishes to take in life. As he thinks about his ___________ he looks down one
path as far as he can see trying to ___________ what life will be like if he walks
that path. He then gazes at the other and decides the outcome of going down
that path would be just as ________________. At this point he concludes that the
________that has been less travelled on would be more ___________ when he
reaches the end of it. The man then decides that he will save the other path
for another day, even though he knows that one path leads to another and
that he won't get a ___________ to go back. The man then says that he will be
telling this story with a sigh someday in the future suggesting that he will
___________ what life would have been like if he had chosen the more walked
path even though the path he chose has made all the difference.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story by Jack London explores the relationship between a man and a dog and the theme of survival. To test how cold it is, the man takes off his glove and can feel just how cold it is. The antagonist in the story is the harsh cold environment. When the man starts his third fire, his dog lays close beside it and the man understands how much his companion means to him. The man's idea of a dog is one who is loyal and understanding. A good word to describe the man is resilient as he finds ways to survive despite the treacherous environment. The man's main fear on his trip is being alone and not being able to make it back home. He makes mistakes in not understanding travelling alone, the dangers he faces, and not listening to people but he does not make a mistake in trusting his dog. The story is a heartbreaking reminder of the strength of the human spirit and the power of loyalty and friendship. My personal reaction to the story is one of sadness.</p><br />

                            10. “Three Sons and a Bundle of Sticks” Once upon a time, an old man lived with his three sons in a village. The three sons were hard workers. Still, they quarreled all the time. The old man tried a lot to unite them but he failed. Though the villagers appreciated their hard work and efforts, they made fun of them on their fights. Months passed by and the old man fell sick. He told his sons to stay united, but they didn’t listen to him, So he decided to teach them a practical lesson so that they would forget their differences and stay united.The old man called his sons. He told them, “ I will give you a bundle of sticks. Separate each stick and you will have to break each stick into two. The one who breaks the sticks quickly will be rewarded more”. The sons agreed. The old man gave a bundle of ten sticks to each of them and asked them to break each stick into two pieces. They broke the sticks into pieces in minutes. And again they started to quarrel among themselves who came first. The old man said, “ Dear sons, the game is not over. Now I will give another bundle of sticks to each of you. You will have to break the sticks as a bundle, not as separate sticks.” The sons agreed and tried to break the bundle of sticks. Though they tried their best, they could not break the bundle. They failed to complete the task. The three sons reported their failure to their father. The old man replied, “Dear sons, see! You could easily break the single sticks into pieces, but you were not able to break the bundle! So if you stay united, nobody can do any harm to you. If you quarrel every time with your brothers, anyone can easily defeat you. I request you to stay united.” The three sons understood the power of unity and promised their father that whatever be the situation, they would all stay together.QUESTIONS;1.

                            17. World War XII, as everyone knows, brought about the collapse of civilization, Towns, cities, and villages disappeared. All the groves and forests were destroyed, and all the gardens, and all the works of art. Men, women, and children became lower than the animals. Discouraged and disillusioned, dogs deserted their fallen masters. Books, paintings and music disappeared from the earth, and human beings just sat around doing nothing. Years went by. Even the few generals who were left forgot what the last war had decided. Boys and girls grew up to stare at each other blankly. Love had passed from the Earth. One day, a young girl who had never seen a flower chanced to come upon the last one in the world. She told the other human beings that the last flower was dying. The only one who paid any attention to her was a young man. Together, the young man and the girl nurtured the flower and it began to live again. One day, a bee visited the flower, and a hummingbird. Before long, there were two flowers, and then a great many. Groves and forests flourished again. The young girl began to take interest in how she looked. The young man discovered that touching the girl was pleasurable. Love was reborn into. the world. The children of the young man and the girl grew up strong and healthy. They learned to run and laugh. Dogs came out of their exile. The young man discovered how to build a shelter. Pretty soon everybody was building shelters. Towns, cities, and villages sprung up. Song came back into the world, and troubadours and jugglers, tailors and cobblers, painters and poets and sculptors, and soldiers and Lieutenants and Captains, and Generals and Major Generals, and liberators. Some people went to one place to live, and some to another. Before long, those who went to the valleys wished they had gone to live in the hills. And those who had to live in the hills wished they had gone to live in the valleys. The liberators, under the guidance of God, set fire to the discontented. So presently, the world was at war again. This time, the destruction was so complete that nothing at all was left in the world, except one man, one woman, and one flower.B.Discuss the following questions1.
