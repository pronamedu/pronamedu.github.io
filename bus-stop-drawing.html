                                            SINGAPORE SOJOURN by Tammy Mendoza When you're a visitor in this remarkable state, one impression that you will have is that people tend to ask you how many times you've been in Singapore. For the past many years, this Asian dragon has become one of the top tourist draws in Asia. Its vibrant economy has made it arguably the gateway in Southeast Asia, and perhaps, on this account, people have grown quite used to tourists seeing Singapore more often than once. Last September, our group flew to Singapore on the largesse of Singapore Airlines, unquestionably one of the pillars of the impressive success story of the city-state. Cited several times as the best airline by prestigious international magazines, Singapore Airlines is a showcase reliability and finesse. And so is the famed Changi Airport. Also, the object of international distinction, the modern airport has consistently been voted the world’s best, and it proves appropriate, interesting insights of what awaits the Singapore guest. Singapore, like the Changi Airport, is a marvel - the fruit of both foresight and careful orchestration. Despite having a land area of only about 650 square kilometers. Singapore has a thriving economy. It has one of the world’s busiest ports, and is conceded as Asia's business and financial center. Singapore by night is a thrilling sight, as we arrived in the Apollo Hotel, there seemed to be so much to look forward to in this sprightly city of surprise. Our next stop was the Night Safari. Now a popular attraction of Singapore, the Nights Safari was probably our best experiences. It features over 1000 nocturnal creatures which one can see either by tram or trail. Because of the way the park was developed, the creatures can be seen in their natural habitat without wire harnesses.

Along the tretch of Orchard Road can be found mall upon quality merchandise for every mold of shopper. After a generous breakfast buffet, we were whisked to the Singapore Science Center. It was here that we viewed a film at Southeast Asians only Omnimax Theater, where images projected on a dome screen gave us the feeling of being engulfed in the picture. Besides the Omninimax Theater, the Singapore Science enter also houses a variety of exhibits on the life science, technology discoveries, and aviation. As for the evening, it belonged to a taxi ride and dinner at Clark's Quay, mainly a cluster of stores by a Singapore river. The highlight of the visit was a taxi ride, where we were taken on a guided tour of the city to better appreciate its history. The following day, the group had splendid time at the Jurong Birdpark which a co-passenger on the taxi ride at Clarks Quay said was his personal choice as the best attraction of Singapore. Here we had breakfast with the birds, a quick tour of the aviaries, and a Panorail ride through the park, after which we viewed the International Bird Show at the amphitheater where trained bird showcased their wares. Some of the more memorable sights at the 20.2-hectare Jurong Birdpark were the Penguin Parade and the Southeast Asian Birds Aviary. With hindsight, the Singapore sojourn turned out to be a truly splendid experience for the group, especially for some of us who tried Singapore's night life for more taste adventure. The thing with Singapore is, it doesn't really matter if you've been there before or not at all. Constantly discovering and ever- changing, Singapore is forever new, and it’s never the same again 1.

                            8. SINGAPORE SOJOURN by Tammy Mendoza When you're a visitor in this remarkable state, one impression that you will have is that people tend to ask you how many times you've been in Singapore. For the past many years, this Asian dragon has become one of the top tourist draws in Asia. Its vibrant economy has made it arguably the gateway in Southeast Asia, and perhaps, on this account, people have grown quite used to tourists seeing Singapore more often than once. Last September, our group flew to Singapore on the largesse of Singapore Airlines, unquestionably one of the pillars of the impressive success story of the city-state. Cited several times as the best airline by prestigious international magazines, Singapore Airlines is a showcase reliability and finesse. And so is the famed Changi Airport. Also, the object of international distinction, the modern airport has consistently been voted the world’s best, and it proves appropriate, interesting insights of what awaits the Singapore guest. Singapore, like the Changi Airport, is a marvel - the fruit of both foresight and careful orchestration. Despite having a land area of only about 650 square kilometers. Singapore has a thriving economy. It has one of the world’s busiest ports, and is conceded as Asia's business and financial center. Singapore by night is a thrilling sight, as we arrived in the Apollo Hotel, there seemed to be so much to look forward to in this sprightly city of surprise. Our next stop was the Night Safari. Now a popular attraction of Singapore, the Nights Safari was probably our best experiences. It features over 1000 nocturnal creatures which one can see either by tram or trail. Because of the way the park was developed, the creatures can be seen in their natural habitat without wire harnesses.

The following day, the group had splendid time at the Jurong Birdpark which a co-passenger on the taxi ride at Clarks Quay said was his personal choice as the best attraction of Singapore. Here we had breakfast with the birds, a quick tour of the aviaries, and a Panorail ride through the park, after which we viewed the International Bird Show at the amphitheater where trained bird showcased their wares. Some of the more memorable sights at the 20.2-hectare Jurong Birdpark were the Penguin Parade and the Southeast Asian Birds Aviary.
