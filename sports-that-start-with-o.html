Every day it was the same problem. On Monday, he forgot his homework so he got trouble from his teacher. On Tuesday, he forgot his school bag so he had to carry all his things around in a plastic bag. On Wednesday, he forgot his sports clothes so he had to miss out on the sports lesson at the school. On Thursday, he forgot his shoes so he had to go to spend all day in bare feet, which of course caused all the other kids at school laughed at him. On Friday, he forgot his permission slip to go to the pool for swimming lessons, so he had to stay back and help the principal do jobs. Billy decided it was time to make a change. He was sick and tired of always forgetting things and getting into trouble and missing out on all the fun. He started writing notes and sticking them on the fridge everyday as soon as he got home from school, with all the things he needed to remember for the next day. Each morning he checked the list and made sure he had everything he needed. It worked! From that day forward Billy never forgot anything again. Until next Friday, of course, when he forgot to write on the note! Text-to-Self- 1. 2. Text-to-Text ext-to-World​</a>

                            15. o ohn L Grade &amp; Section: COLD Activity 2 Text 1 LOST AND FOUND Billy was lovely boy but he had a big problem. Billy was always forgetting things! Every day it was the same problem. On Monday, he forgot his homework so he got trouble from his teacher. On Tuesday, he forgot his school bag so he had to carry all his things around in a plastic bag. On Wednesday, he forgot his sports clothes so he had to miss out on the sports lesson at the school. On Thursday, he forgot his shoes so he had to go to spend all day in bare feet, which of course caused all the other kids at school laughed at him. On Friday, he forgot his permission slip to go to the pool for swimming lessons, so he had to stay back and help the principal do jobs. Billy decided it was time to make a change. He was sick and tired of always forgetting things and getting into trouble and missing out on all the fun. He started writing notes and sticking them on the fridge everyday as soon as he got home from school, with all the things he needed to remember for the next day. Each morning he checked the list and made sure he had everything he needed. It worked! From that day forward Billy never forgot anything again. Until next Friday, of course, when he forgot to write on the note! Text-to-Self- 1. 2. Text-to-Text ext-to-World​</h2><br />
