                                            CAN YOU CHECK THE GRAMMAR AND EVERYTHING? We all know that physical change are changes that affect the form of a chemical substance, but not its chemical composition. In our case we took pictures of a plastic cup that was crumpled , rectangular woods were cut, an umbrella that was folded, a tile broke, and a building that was destroyed because we knew that it physical change occur to this objects . For the plastic cup we can see that it is still a physical change because even though the paper cup was crumpled it's chemical composition is still the same. From a tree that was cut to some rectangular woods we can say that it still a physical change because they just use saw for cutting the tree into rectangular woods and no chemicals were put. The umbrella that was folded is also a physical change because the wind just blew the umbrella. A tile that was broken is also a physical change, it just broke and no chemical composition was change. Lastly, the building that was destroyed, it shows that from a building that is use by some students to destroyed building. It is physical because even though the building was destroyed we can still say that it's parts is from the building.</a>

                                            Consider a case in which an individual has been arrested on suspicion of supplying drugs to users. At the time of the arrest, the person concerned was found to be in possession of 12 individual sachet of what appeared to be "Drugs", wrapped in brown paper. A subsequent search of the arrested person’s house revealed a roll of brown paper, from which some paper had apparently been torn, a quantity of white powder in a strong plastic bag and several packets of caffeine tablets. Shortly after the arrest, a known drug user, who lived in the same barangay as the arrested person, was caught in possession of what appeared to be a dose of "Drugs" wrapped in brown paper. Review the potential that forensic science has to help the investigation of this case and the types of forensic analysis that may be used in such an investigation.​</a>

In our case we took pictures of a plastic cup that was crumpled , rectangular woods were cut, an umbrella that was folded, a tile broke, and a building that was destroyed because we knew that it physical change occur to this objects . For the plastic cup we can see that it is still a physical change because even though the paper cup was crumpled it's chemical composition is still the same. From a tree that was cut to some rectangular woods we can say that it still a physical change because they just use saw for cutting the tree into rectangular woods and no chemicals were put. The umbrella that was folded is also a physical change because the wind just blew the umbrella. A tile that was broken is also a physical change, it just broke and no chemical composition was change. Lastly, the building that was destroyed, it shows that from a building that is use by some students to destroyed building. It is physical because even though the building was destroyed we can still say that it's parts is from the building.</h2><br />

                            30. Consider a case in which an individual has been arrested on suspicion of supplying drugs to users. At the time of the arrest, the person concerned was found to be in possession of 12 individual sachet of what appeared to be "Drugs", wrapped in brown paper. A subsequent search of the arrested person’s house revealed a roll of brown paper, from which some paper had apparently been torn, a quantity of white powder in a strong plastic bag and several packets of caffeine tablets. Shortly after the arrest, a known drug user, who lived in the same barangay as the arrested person, was caught in possession of what appeared to be a dose of "Drugs" wrapped in brown paper. Review the potential that forensic science has to help the investigation of this case and the types of forensic analysis that may be used in such an investigation.​</h2><br />
