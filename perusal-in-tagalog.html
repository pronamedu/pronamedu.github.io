Simultaneously, most parents and carers can recall the days whencellphones didn't exist, and kids were really left all alone for in any event half of the day. I acceptcellphones today represent an incredible interruption for students — particularly better quality phonesthat give various chances to diversion — and therefore ought to be restricted from use in schools; andyet, I represent not forbidding cellphones from student’s ownership completely, since they permitguardians to screen their kids' wellbeing.The above all else motivation behind why cellphones ought to be restricted from use in schools is thatthey represent a huge interruption in the instructive procedure. The most evident sign of suchdisturbance is cheating during tests or different tests: access to the Internet, electronic books, andtalking with peers through any messaging or correspondence application directly from the study hall.Telephone rings, approaching message signals, as well as games, meddle with the instructiveprocedure by diverting educators and students from classes. Regardless of whether the sound is onsilent, a telephone's vibration despite everything diverts students.Another reason behind banning cellphones in classes is an expanded allurement for understudies tospeak with companions as opposed to concentrating on study material. By and by, the degree ofinnovation permits sharp cell phone proprietors to consistently check their informal organisationprofiles and peruse Internet content. Messaging itself, while being a very well known method forversatile correspondence among youth, turns out to be much all the more enticing when anunderstudy is tuning in to talk however has their brain meandering.One of the abnormal occurrences of utilising cellphones in schools is cyberbullying. Cellphonecameras are being utilised increasingly more frequently to record and spread unseemly pictures, forexample, photos of understudies in bathrooms; pictures of the inner parts of understudies' storagespaces; recordings of genuine and organised battles between understudies, just as the chronicles ofthe mortification of disagreeable understudies, etc. What's more, there were situations when modestpaid ahead of time 'disposable' telephones were utilised by understudies for bomb dangers.In spite of the fact that cellphones are important for high school students regarding their security, theyshould at present be restricted from use during classes. This idea is established on a few reasons, forexample, upsetting the instructive procedure and encouraging students cheating; divertingunderstudies by the likelihood to get to the Internet, web-based life, or speak with companions;likewise, cellphones add to the spreading of the social marvel known as cyberbullying.​</a>

In November 1970, he contracted with AB to have 750 cartons of milk delivered from Manila to Urdaneta. However, only 150 boxes were delivered since only one of the trucks was hijacked during its trip by armed men. AB demanded to the junk dealer to pay for the lost merchandise and cargo. is the junk dealer a common carrier so as to be bound to exercise extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over the goods? Can he not use the fortuitous event as a defense in order to be absolved from liability?</a>

P-A-H-E-L-PIs the evidence provided strong or weak?Is the evidence enough to support the claim a reason?Why Cell Phones Should Not Be Allowed In SchoolsToday, practically any parent can utilise a cellphone to get some information about their whereabouts,occupation, or wellbeing. Simultaneously, most parents and carers can recall the days whencellphones didn't exist, and kids were really left all alone for in any event half of the day. I acceptcellphones today represent an incredible interruption for students — particularly better quality phonesthat give various chances to diversion — and therefore ought to be restricted from use in schools; andyet, I represent not forbidding cellphones from student’s ownership completely, since they permitguardians to screen their kids' wellbeing.The above all else motivation behind why cellphones ought to be restricted from use in schools is thatthey represent a huge interruption in the instructive procedure. The most evident sign of suchdisturbance is cheating during tests or different tests: access to the Internet, electronic books, andtalking with peers through any messaging or correspondence application directly from the study hall.Telephone rings, approaching message signals, as well as games, meddle with the instructiveprocedure by diverting educators and students from classes. Regardless of whether the sound is onsilent, a telephone's vibration despite everything diverts students.Another reason behind banning cellphones in classes is an expanded allurement for understudies tospeak with companions as opposed to concentrating on study material. By and by, the degree ofinnovation permits sharp cell phone proprietors to consistently check their informal organisationprofiles and peruse Internet content. Messaging itself, while being a very well known method forversatile correspondence among youth, turns out to be much all the more enticing when anunderstudy is tuning in to talk however has their brain meandering.One of the abnormal occurrences of utilising cellphones in schools is cyberbullying. Cellphonecameras are being utilised increasingly more frequently to record and spread unseemly pictures, forexample, photos of understudies in bathrooms; pictures of the inner parts of understudies' storagespaces; recordings of genuine and organised battles between understudies, just as the chronicles ofthe mortification of disagreeable understudies, etc. What's more, there were situations when modestpaid ahead of time 'disposable' telephones were utilised by understudies for bomb dangers.In spite of the fact that cellphones are important for high school students regarding their security, theyshould at present be restricted from use during classes. This idea is established on a few reasons, forexample, upsetting the instructive procedure and encouraging students cheating; divertingunderstudies by the likelihood to get to the Internet, web-based life, or speak with companions;likewise, cellphones add to the spreading of the social marvel known as cyberbullying.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>No. Even though he was yet to board the train, he had a fist fight with the security guard of LRT tracks. But it depends on the situation, since the guard is only allowed when ejecting or detaining a person on private property. The use of force should be reasonable based on the severity of the crime at hand, the risk facing the guard and other individuals. The guard will be held liable if he was doing his or her job, carrying out what he was told. Most likely, the company will not be held responsible for the incident.</p><strong>#CarryOnLearning:)</strong><p></p><br />

</p><p>This study examines how journalists in the Philippines perceive their roles in response to mis- and disinformation. In the country’s current media landscape, journalists find themselves in the spotlight as the media are frequently accused of spreading falsehoods. Drawing from data gathered through 16 semistructured in-depth interviews with Filipino journalists, the findings first of all indicate that the disseminator and watchdog roles are perceived as more important and that journalists see themselves as truth crusaders and advocates of societal reform.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>A.
</strong></p><p><strong>In order to solve this problem, you need to understand first the Aufbau Principle. It is defined - Electrons fill atomic orbitals of the lowest available energy levels before occupying higher levels.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1. Second level and orbital has not yet reached the maximum number of electrons before putting another orbital.
</strong></p><p><strong>  </strong></p><p><strong>2.  </strong></p><p><strong>S(Sharp) Orbital can only contain 2 electrons
</strong></p><p><strong>P(Principal) Orbital can only contain 6 electrons
</strong></p><p><strong>D(Diffuse) Orbital can only contain 10 electrons
</strong></p><p><strong>F(Fundamental) Orbital can only contain 14 electrons
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>On the example, the 2nd level contains orbitals that handles electrons exceeding to its maximum capacity.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3.
</strong></p><p><strong>Each level needs to have s(sharp) orbitals before others.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>4.
</strong></p><p><strong>Like on the first example, the fourth level and orbital is yet reached the maximum number of electrons before putting another orbital.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>5.
</strong></p><p><strong>The second level and p orbital needs to contain 6 electrons before stepping up to higher level.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>B.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In order to solve this problems, you need to understand first Hund's rule. It is defined - every orbital in a subshell is singly occupied with one electron before any one orbital is doubly occupied, and all electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1.
</strong></p><p><strong>The second box(orbital) should be filled first before goind to higher orbitals.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2.
</strong></p><p><strong>The first orbital is wrong. The spin matters alot in electron configuration.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3.
</strong></p><p><strong>Can't see anything wrong.
</strong></p><p><strong>
