(10 points)My biggest "sana"  is that, I hope the selected student to my research paper will learn and value my work as like them a student's .This particularly help them to enhance there knowledged and may help them to control their time to manage all work that must be done. Although most of the student that I selected know what is time management in all particular basis, but as me a working student who have a lot work to finish will really appreciated the time management in order to passed and get finish on time.Therefore, I don't not say that only working student will just appreciate  and value this research paper, hence those student who have a responsibilities to their families will learn also. As if you can hear the words "time management" is very easy to figure out, but there's a lot of teenager having difficulty to their mental health specially those people having anxiety, trauma, and depression will having trouble to control there time and self. My point is that, in this research i hope the students will learn from this.​</a>

(Juan Tamad and the Guava Tree)
Once there was a boy who was so lazy and his name was Juan Tamad (Tamad is the Filipino word for lazy). He was so lazy he would always spend some time thinking how to outwit the work-requiring situation. One day, he saw a guava tree and spotted a shiny ripe fruit hanging on its branch. It's not even a top branch. It was hanging so low that had he not been too lazy to stretch out his arm and jump up a little, he would have grabbed the fruit in no time. But Juan, oh Juan, being clever (at least for himself), didn't bother to do those two simple steps at all! "Hah! Why would I reach for that fruit when I know it would eventually reach for me?" He said to himself and devised a rather silly plan. He cleared the ground just below the shiny fruit and lied himself down like a god with some berries in hand, except that Juan didn't have his fruit yet. "I will wait here until that guava fruit falls right into my mouth. Then I wouldn't have to shove the fruit inside my mouth myself. Gravity will do it." So there Juan lied down day in and day out. Until one day, he felt some splatter of juice and seeds all over his face. He opened his eyes and saw a happy bat enjoying his feast on a reddish, fat and shiny guava fruit. And Juan finally gave up his devised plan and walked home with a long, tiring.</a>

                                            Exercise # 2One evening in September, the villagers gathered talking about the strong typhoon that hittheir place. The flood destroyed their crops. They were worried about the coming year.Suddenly a queer sound was heard from the bamboo thicket. Out came a little man with a longbeard and long sharp nose!The people were frightened. The small creature began to talk:“I'm a friend. I came here to be of help.”“An elf!" shouted Nay Binay, the oldest in the group.“I heard what happened here,” said the elf. If you wish, I'll stay here to help you. I don't wantany wages. All I ask for is a corner in a 'tambobo' where I can sleep and a bowl of rice set on thefloor at night."After a week's time, the villagers told many stories about what the good elf had done forthem. whenever there was work to be done, the elf would be there to do it.One night, a kind couple agreed to give something to the elf in return for his labours. Theyplaced shirts, trousers and a pair of boots for him beside the bowl of rice in his “tambobo"The kind elf saw those things. “They are paying me for my work. I have to leave them. Onlywhen a good little child finds me will I come back," uttered the small man. So the elf left in themiddle of the night.Questions:​</a>

"The Story of the Disobedient Son"
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first so was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
At that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present conditions. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant." So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant." His father lifted his lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy. My son was lost. Now he is fount."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told his, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore, should we not rejoice?" The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.</a>

                                            The Prodigal Son
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first son was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was a very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
AT that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present condition. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."
So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home. 
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant."
His father lifted him lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy ourselves. My son was lost. Now he is fond."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told him, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your work. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"
The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.

                                            The Prodigal Son Luke 15: 11-32 A man had two sons. One day, the younger of the two demanded the share of his father's property that would belong to him when his father died. His father gave it to him, and after a few days, the boy left home on a long journey Here, he wasted the money and lived a wild life. When the money was all spent, there came a famine, and he began to be in serious need. He found some work in looking after the pigs of a farmer in that district. But there was nothing he could eat except what the pigs ate. At last, he was so hungry and so hopeless that he started to consider who he was and what sort of person he had become. He saw that he was poorer than the poorest of his father's servants. Then he decided to return home. He planned to admit that he had done wrong and to ask his father to employ him as a servant, since he could not expect to be treated as a son any longer So, he made the long journey home. But before he could reach the house, his father saw him. He saw the boy's misery and ran down the road and welcomed him with affection. The boy began to speak of the wrong that he had done, but before he could ask to be employed as a servant, his father called for a rove of honor and put it on him. Then he gave him a ring and sandals to show that he was fully accepted as his son, and a feast was prepared so that everyone could share in his father's joy. The other son had been working on the farm. As he returned to the house, he heard the singing and the hand clapping, and asked what had happened. His father came out and begged him to join in the feast. But he said, "I have worked for you for years, yet you never made a feast for me. Now you welcome this son of yours who had wasted your money!" Then his father said gently, "My boy, of course we must welcome him home. He is not only 'my son' as you call him; he is your brother. Come inside and share my joy. The one that was lost has now been found." write summary in your answer sheet ​</a>

Personal E Narrative I have learned in this lesson that paragraph development differs according to the purpose of the writer or the choice of text type. Let's say, if I want to convince others of my opinion or point of view, I will write a 1. text. If I want to tell a story, like those in literature, what I would write is a 2. For a 3. recount, I have to draw from my past experiences while for factual recount, this has to be something I have observed or studied with expertise. As for 4. text, this is an informative text that clearly and precisely explains the WHYs and HOWs behind a phenomenon, view, or process in an authoritative manner. That is, with supporting examples, evidence, and valid sources. Lastly, to write alan 5. paragraph, it's best to write on something I know too well, or have researched myself. Here, I will either give instructions on how something works or is done step-by-step, or simply write a report about a particular topic.​</a>

                                            Summary of                                                Close knit family I don't view my important characteristics as different from those my family has imparted on me throughout the years. The pride, care, dedication, effort, and hard-working attitude that I view as critical to any success I may achieve have all descended upon me courtesy of my close-knit, Italian family. Born the child of two immigrants who came here with nothing, only one possessing a college degree, the importance of a good work ethic was stressed by my parents from day one. Through their actions in their jobs and through the verbal lessons on life I began to get from the moment I could communicate, they set an example for me to follow, one of being proud of what I do, no matter what it was, and above all, to care about everything I do as if everything had a big impact. This meant that everything had to be done right and be done well. Undoubtedly, following their own advice carried my parents from their status as blue-collar immigrants who labored as factory workers to white-collar citizens, one of whom owns his own business while the other works as a bank officer. Those ascensions from nothing only served as other examples for me to follow, examples that delineated the ability for a person to improve through effort. Another quotation from my father propelled me from the time I started school to today: "No matter what you do, you have to be the best." This set up the inner drive that motivates all my actions. It was what forced me to try hard in school although I didn't know English well enough to always understand the teacher. It's the reason why I have developed my skills. It accounts for my dedication to all activities, and to the hard work I put into all of them as I strive to lead both in class and out. Essentially, my parentage was the first quality that distinguished me as a leader. Despite all the talk of being a leader, I have never lost sight of the importance of my family. I know I owe my family everything, and as a result, I'll always be close with it.​</a>

                                            my existence is pointless, nobody checksup on mne, never had any real friends since 1stgrade, never even held a girl's hand all of my life,everyone living happily while l'm here sitting bymyself wondering what life I could've had. All my lifeI've been ignored and pushed aside, I built myselfup to be fit, be friends with everyone, be good andchanged my appearance entirely just to be treatedthe exact same.. maybe even more worse. I like tobelieve maybe something happy will happen to mebut I can't lie to myself anymore. One small amountof pain to end centuries of future pain, but I leaveeven more pain for those around me like my familyand non-existant friends. Who knows maybe theywont even know I'm gone. I don't recognize myselfanymore, the conversations in my head are theonly conversations I have all day. I've suffered andI've suffered, yet I see no difference in happinessor sadness. Im in a vague abyss of loneliness,I'm wasting my prime years... l just need at least1 human to take a chance on me, to at least bethere to hear my story. Its been over 3 years andits a miracle I'm still here, but I dont feel the sparkanymore. I feel like within the next year I wont behere anymore. Im a disappointment. Those beforeme gave their lives for me to end it bc of loneliness.I deserve this I'm a terrible human for the thingsI've done. Ive tried everything: medication, workingout, etc... yet I'm still empty. You wanna know sumCRAZY? Recently I've had the worst sadness everyet I couldn't produce a tear, I just sat in silence and embraced the feeling for hours on end. I dont havea number for what day will be my last, but I knowfor those around me, it'll be like an average day. Nodifference, no emotion towards my demise, I'm godslonely man. bye.​</a>

His father gave it to himand after a few days, the boy left home on a long journeyHere, he wasted the money and lived a wild life.When the money was all spent, there came a famine,and he began to be in serious need. He found somework in looking after the pigs of a farmer in that district.But there was nothing he could eat except what thepigs ate.At last, he was so hungry and so hopeless thathe started to consider who he was and what sort ofperson he had become. He saw that he was poorer than the poorest of his father'sservants. Then he decided to return home. He planned to admit that he had done wrongand to ask his father to employ him as a servant, since he could not expect to be treatedas a son any longer.So he made the long journey home. But before he could reach the house, hisfather saw him. He saw the boy's misery, and ran down the road and welcomed him withaffection. The boy began to speak of the wrong that he had done, but before he couldask to be employed as a servant, his father called for a robe of honor and put it on him.Then he gave him a ring and sandals to show that he was fully accepted and his son,and a feast was prepared so that everyone could share in his father's joy.The other son had been working on the farm. As he returned to the house, heheard the singing and the hand clapping, and asked what had happened. His fathercame out and begged him to join in the feast. But he said, "I have worked for you foryears, yet you never made feast for me. Now you welcome this son of yours who havewasted your money!" Then his father said gently, "My boy, of course we must welcomehim home. He is not only "my son" as you call him; he is your brother. Come inside andshare my joy.

(Juan Tamad and the Guava Tree)
Once there was a boy who was so lazy and his name was Juan Tamad (Tamad is the Filipino word for lazy). He was so lazy he would always spend some time thinking how to outwit the work-requiring situation. One day, he saw a guava tree and spotted a shiny ripe fruit hanging on its branch. It's not even a top branch. It was hanging so low that had he not been too lazy to stretch out his arm and jump up a little, he would have grabbed the fruit in no time. But Juan, oh Juan, being clever (at least for himself), didn't bother to do those two simple steps at all! "Hah! Why would I reach for that fruit when I know it would eventually reach for me?" He said to himself and devised a rather silly plan. He cleared the ground just below the shiny fruit and lied himself down like a god with some berries in hand, except that Juan didn't have his fruit yet. "I will wait here until that guava fruit falls right into my mouth. Then I wouldn't have to shove the fruit inside my mouth myself. Gravity will do it." So there Juan lied down day in and day out. Until one day, he felt some splatter of juice and seeds all over his face. He opened his eyes and saw a happy bat enjoying his feast on a reddish, fat and shiny guava fruit. And Juan finally gave up his devised plan and walked home with a long, tiring.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Juan obviously did not reach the fruit.Since Juan did not reach the fruit and wait to fall for it to him, he never had to eat or taste the guava.<br />

They were worried about the coming year.Suddenly a queer sound was heard from the bamboo thicket. Out came a little man with a longbeard and long sharp nose!The people were frightened. The small creature began to talk:“I'm a friend. I came here to be of help.”“An elf!" shouted Nay Binay, the oldest in the group.“I heard what happened here,” said the elf. If you wish, I'll stay here to help you. I don't wantany wages. All I ask for is a corner in a 'tambobo' where I can sleep and a bowl of rice set on thefloor at night."After a week's time, the villagers told many stories about what the good elf had done forthem. whenever there was work to be done, the elf would be there to do it.One night, a kind couple agreed to give something to the elf in return for his labours. Theyplaced shirts, trousers and a pair of boots for him beside the bowl of rice in his “tambobo"The kind elf saw those things. “They are paying me for my work. I have to leave them. Onlywhen a good little child finds me will I come back," uttered the small man. So the elf left in themiddle of the night.Questions:​</h2><br />

"The Story of the Disobedient Son"
There was a very rich person. He had two sons. The first so was hard working. He always obeyed his father. He was very good and nice person. But the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his father’s field. He was disobedient to his father. He wanted to lead a gay and free life.
One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property. He left home with his share. He went to a distant land. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his property lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too. He wasted all the money. Soon he was left with no money. His friends saw this. They all deserted him one by one.
At that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present conditions. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant." So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.
One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant." His father lifted his lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best robe. Put it on my son. Put a ring on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy. My son was lost. Now he is fount."
The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told his, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration."
The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him!"
His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore, should we not rejoice?" The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are two main characters in the story "The Story of the Disobedient Son": the first son and the second son. The first son is described as hardworking, obedient, and a good and nice person. The second son, on the other hand, is described as lazy, disobedient, and wanting to lead a free and carefree life. The second son also has bad habits and wastes his money, leading him to become poor and take a job feeding pigs. In contrast, the first son is obedient and works hard, but becomes angry when he sees his father celebrating the return of the second son. The father is a loving and forgiving character who is always thinking of his second son and rejoices at his return. Overall, the first son is portrayed as responsible and dutiful, while the second son is portrayed as reckless and irresponsible.</p><br />

                            11. The Prodigal Son Luke 15: 11-32 A man had two sons. One day, the younger of the two demanded the share of his father's property that would belong to him when his father died. His father gave it to him, and after a few days, the boy left home on a long journey Here, he wasted the money and lived a wild life. When the money was all spent, there came a famine, and he began to be in serious need. He found some work in looking after the pigs of a farmer in that district. But there was nothing he could eat except what the pigs ate. At last, he was so hungry and so hopeless that he started to consider who he was and what sort of person he had become. He saw that he was poorer than the poorest of his father's servants. Then he decided to return home. He planned to admit that he had done wrong and to ask his father to employ him as a servant, since he could not expect to be treated as a son any longer So, he made the long journey home. But before he could reach the house, his father saw him. He saw the boy's misery and ran down the road and welcomed him with affection. The boy began to speak of the wrong that he had done, but before he could ask to be employed as a servant, his father called for a rove of honor and put it on him. Then he gave him a ring and sandals to show that he was fully accepted as his son, and a feast was prepared so that everyone could share in his father's joy. The other son had been working on the farm. As he returned to the house, he heard the singing and the hand clapping, and asked what had happened. His father came out and begged him to join in the feast. But he said, "I have worked for you for years, yet you never made a feast for me. Now you welcome this son of yours who had wasted your money!" Then his father said gently, "My boy, of course we must welcome him home. He is not only 'my son' as you call him; he is your brother. Come inside and share my joy. The one that was lost has now been found." write summary in your answer sheet ​</h2><br />

Personal E Narrative I have learned in this lesson that paragraph development differs according to the purpose of the writer or the choice of text type. Let's say, if I want to convince others of my opinion or point of view, I will write a 1. text. If I want to tell a story, like those in literature, what I would write is a 2. For a 3. recount, I have to draw from my past experiences while for factual recount, this has to be something I have observed or studied with expertise. As for 4. text, this is an informative text that clearly and precisely explains the WHYs and HOWs behind a phenomenon, view, or process in an authoritative manner. That is, with supporting examples, evidence, and valid sources. Lastly, to write alan 5. paragraph, it's best to write on something I know too well, or have researched myself. Here, I will either give instructions on how something works or is done step-by-step, or simply write a report about a particular topic.​</h2><br />

                            23. Summary of                                                Close knit family I don't view my important characteristics as different from those my family has imparted on me throughout the years. The pride, care, dedication, effort, and hard-working attitude that I view as critical to any success I may achieve have all descended upon me courtesy of my close-knit, Italian family. Born the child of two immigrants who came here with nothing, only one possessing a college degree, the importance of a good work ethic was stressed by my parents from day one. Through their actions in their jobs and through the verbal lessons on life I began to get from the moment I could communicate, they set an example for me to follow, one of being proud of what I do, no matter what it was, and above all, to care about everything I do as if everything had a big impact. This meant that everything had to be done right and be done well. Undoubtedly, following their own advice carried my parents from their status as blue-collar immigrants who labored as factory workers to white-collar citizens, one of whom owns his own business while the other works as a bank officer. Those ascensions from nothing only served as other examples for me to follow, examples that delineated the ability for a person to improve through effort. Another quotation from my father propelled me from the time I started school to today: "No matter what you do, you have to be the best." This set up the inner drive that motivates all my actions. It was what forced me to try hard in school although I didn't know English well enough to always understand the teacher. It's the reason why I have developed my skills. It accounts for my dedication to all activities, and to the hard work I put into all of them as I strive to lead both in class and out. Essentially, my parentage was the first quality that distinguished me as a leader. Despite all the talk of being a leader, I have never lost sight of the importance of my family. I know I owe my family everything, and as a result, I'll always be close with it.​</h2><br />

All my lifeI've been ignored and pushed aside, I built myselfup to be fit, be friends with everyone, be good andchanged my appearance entirely just to be treatedthe exact same.. maybe even more worse. I like tobelieve maybe something happy will happen to mebut I can't lie to myself anymore. One small amountof pain to end centuries of future pain, but I leaveeven more pain for those around me like my familyand non-existant friends. Who knows maybe theywont even know I'm gone. I don't recognize myselfanymore, the conversations in my head are theonly conversations I have all day. I've suffered andI've suffered, yet I see no difference in happinessor sadness. Im in a vague abyss of loneliness,I'm wasting my prime years... l just need at least1 human to take a chance on me, to at least bethere to hear my story. Its been over 3 years andits a miracle I'm still here, but I dont feel the sparkanymore. I feel like within the next year I wont behere anymore. Im a disappointment. Those beforeme gave their lives for me to end it bc of loneliness.I deserve this I'm a terrible human for the thingsI've done. Ive tried everything: medication, workingout, etc... yet I'm still empty. You wanna know sumCRAZY? Recently I've had the worst sadness everyet I couldn't produce a tear, I just sat in silence and embraced the feeling for hours on end. I dont havea number for what day will be my last, but I knowfor those around me, it'll be like an average day. Nodifference, no emotion towards my demise, I'm godslonely man. bye.​</h2><br />

He found somework in looking after the pigs of a farmer in that district.But there was nothing he could eat except what thepigs ate.At last, he was so hungry and so hopeless thathe started to consider who he was and what sort ofperson he had become. He saw that he was poorer than the poorest of his father'sservants. Then he decided to return home. He planned to admit that he had done wrongand to ask his father to employ him as a servant, since he could not expect to be treatedas a son any longer.So he made the long journey home. But before he could reach the house, hisfather saw him. He saw the boy's misery, and ran down the road and welcomed him withaffection. The boy began to speak of the wrong that he had done, but before he couldask to be employed as a servant, his father called for a robe of honor and put it on him.Then he gave him a ring and sandals to show that he was fully accepted and his son,and a feast was prepared so that everyone could share in his father's joy.The other son had been working on the farm. As he returned to the house, heheard the singing and the hand clapping, and asked what had happened. His fathercame out and begged him to join in the feast. But he said, "I have worked for you foryears, yet you never made feast for me. Now you welcome this son of yours who havewasted your money!"
