Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text types. The phrase "Text type" is a way of classifying and defining different types of language interaction, both spoken and written. It refers to the purpose of a text and the way it is written. Here are some examples of different text types: Classification - Explanation • Enumeration Time order Classification-It classifies, describes, and gives information about people, animals and things or phenomena. Weather is the continuous changing conditions of air around us. These changes can take many forms, including wind, rain, and show. They influence how people live every day. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close-fitting clothes when it is cold. Explanation-A factual text type that explains how or why something happen. It begins with the topic, describes items related to the topic in the right order, and explains how these items are related to each other. It may have a conclusion. This type is written in the present tense. The building of gases in the Earth's atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so many gases in the atmosphere, Earth becomes like a greenhouse because the heat from the surface cannot easily escape into the outer space. Because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to the outer space, there is global warming, thus, the temperature of the Earth rises a Guide Questions: 1. What are the first two types of text according to purpose? 2. What is the difference between classification text and explanation text?​</a>

Mars has water as well on its surface but what do you think makes it not suitable for life?3. Oxygen gas is essential for living things like animals while carbon dioxide is essentialfor plants. Which among the four planets has these gases in its atmosphere?4. Mercury has a very thin to almost none atmosphere because of the sun's flares andits weak gravity. What do you think might happen if living things thrived on Mercury?5. Venus and Mars have atmospheres that are mostly made up of carbon dioxide whichcan be harmful to animals but is essential for plants. Do you think life can take place onthese planets? Why or why not?6. Water boils at 100 °C and freezes at 0 °C. Given this, refer to the table above andcompare mercury's minimum and maximum temperature to water's boiling and freezingpoint. Why do you think there is no life on Mercury based on its temperature?7. Because of its distance from the sun and massive amount of carbon dioxide on itsatmosphere, Venus is regarded as the hottest planet in the solar system. Based on the dataon the table above showing its minimum and maximum temperature, explain why life cannotsurvive on Venus8. All the planets that were compared are terrestrial planets or planets with rocky surface. What do you think is the relationship of having a rocky surface rather than agaseous one (like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) on a planet's ability to support life?9. What can you say about Earth's temperature compared to other planets? Is it too hotor too cold or just enough for life to occur?10.In conclusion, discuss how Earth's unique characteristics enabled it to support life.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. Earth and Mars 2. Mars Surface has frozen ice and has no oxygen or liquid water 3. Earth has both while Venus and mars only have carbon dioxide.4. They will struggle due to low gravity and basically have no atmosphere for them to breathe.5. Nope. because most plants need a Perfect condition like the temperature too hot the plant will dry and dies too  cold the plant will freeze and dies.6. Mercury has extremely high max temperatures that can be enough to boil water in daytime while night time the temperatures are so low that can freeze water7. Because of high temperatures will burn Most life thus no life can exist on venus.8. A Rocky Planet can Be the basis of life since gaseous planets have little to no ground or soil to support life. since most life need a surface or soil to have plants and animals terrestrial and rocky planets are better than gaseous planets.9. Earth's atmosphere And temperature Is JUST right Enough for life to exist.10. Earth has Oxygen,Nitrogen, Carbon dioxide, and other gases that keeps the ecosystems running meanwhile a protective ozone layer prevents the sun deadly rays from reaching the ground. The amount of water and soil in the ground with the right temperature is the perfect recipe for life on earth. <p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            14. Read Introduction part-text types: classification, explanation.explanation, enumeration.and time order. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text types. The phrase "Text type" is a way of classifying and defining different types of language interaction, both spoken and written. It refers to the purpose of a text and the way it is written. Here are some examples of different text types: Classification - Explanation • Enumeration Time order Classification-It classifies, describes, and gives information about people, animals and things or phenomena. Weather is the continuous changing conditions of air around us. These changes can take many forms, including wind, rain, and show. They influence how people live every day. When it rains or snows, many persons are often forced to stay indoors. Weather also affects one's choice of clothes. One wears light clothes when the weather is hot and thick, close-fitting clothes when it is cold. Explanation-A factual text type that explains how or why something happen. It begins with the topic, describes items related to the topic in the right order, and explains how these items are related to each other. It may have a conclusion. This type is written in the present tense. The building of gases in the Earth's atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so many gases in the atmosphere, Earth becomes like a greenhouse because the heat from the surface cannot easily escape into the outer space. Because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to the outer space, there is global warming, thus, the temperature of the Earth rises a Guide Questions: 1. What are the first two types of text according to purpose? 2. What is the difference between classification text and explanation text?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.Broadly speaking, there are two main text types, factual and literary. Within these are many more narrowly defined text types. Factual text types include such types as factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include such types as poetry, narrative or personal response.</p><p></p><p>2.Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.</p><br />
