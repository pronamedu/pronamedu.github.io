                                            What is the main idea of this text
Recent research on wealth and household finances seeks to blend neoclassical models with an understanding of real-world imperfections to answer questions about why some people save and others do not. This paper focuses on Baby Boomers standing on the verge of retirement, many of whom have saved little and will face financial insecurity in old age. The new 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement Study is invaluable for this first analysis of the financial situation of leading-edge Boomers, as it reports not only wealth levels but also information about respondents' planning behaviors and economic literacy. We show that the distribution of net worth among Early Baby Boomers is quite skewed, those in the 75th percentile had over 10 times the net worth ($400K) of households in the bottom 25th percentile ($37K). There is substantial heterogeneity in wealth within this cohort: the median high-school dropout had less than $23K in total net worth, while the median college graduate had over 10 times as much. Many Black and Hispanic Boomer households hold miniscule levels of wealth. Further, many in this cohort have accumulated little wealth outside their homes: at the mean, one third of the early Boomers' wealth is held in the form of home equity, and at the median the fraction is close to half. Since many members of this EBB cohort are reaching retirement with a substantial portion of their wealth in housing, they are particularly vulnerable to housing value shocks. By contrast, holders of stocks, IRAs, and business equity are concentrated in the top quartiles, Finally, we show that planning and economic literacy are important predictors of savings and investment success.</a>

She believes that the Philippines is the best place to visit because of its peace-loving people, beautiful sceneries and great ambiance.Paragraph 2: Crying is an infant's natural way of communicating his/her mother. When a child cries, it only means something; either he/she is hungry, restless, uncomfortable, sleepy, or not feeling well. And this meaning is taken ordinarily by a mother's instinct. That is why everybody says that all mothers know best.Paragraph 3: Obedience is one of the virtues that is forgotten by the youth of this era. Because of this situation, it is believed that every child's foundation must be built at home seriously and later be honed by society.Paragraph 4: Roberto was born to a well-off family whose dedication to public service reaches the peak of the mountain.

                                            Corona Virus Disease - 19 The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. We have now reached the tragic milestone of one million deaths, and the human family is suffering under an almost intolerable burden of loss. "The climbing dcath toll is staggering, and we must work together to slow the spread of this virus." - UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. But the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, it's also an unprecedented socio- economic crisis. Stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political effects that will leave deep and longstanding scars. UNDP is the technical lead in the UN's socio-economic recovery, alongside the health response, led by WHO, and the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and working under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinators. Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 400 million jobs could be lost. The World Bank projects a US$110 billion decline in remittances this year, which could mean 800 million people will not be able to meet their basic needs.(Retrieved from: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/coronavirus.html)​</a>

The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</a>

                                            LISTENING TEXT The Lion-Makers by Vishnu Sharma In a certain town were 4 Brahmans who lived in friendship. Three of them had reached the far shore of scholarship but lacked sense. The other found scholarship distasteful, he had nothing but sense. One day they met for consultation, "What is the use of attainments," they said, "if one does not travel, win the favour of kings, and acquire money? Whatever we do, let us all travel" But when they had gone a little way, the eldest of them said, 'One of us, the fourth, is a dullard having nothing but sense. Now nobody gains the favourable attention of kings by sense without scholarship. Therefore, we will not share our earnings with him. Let him tum back and go home." Then the second said, "My intelligent friend, you lack scholarship. Please go home." But the third said, "No, no. This is no way to behave. For we have played together since we were little boys. Come along, my noble friend. You shall have a share of the money we will eam." With this agreement, they continued their joumey, and in a forest found the bones of a dead lion. Thereupon one of them said, "A good opportunity to test the ripeness of our scholarship. Here lies some kind of creature, dead. Let us bring it to life by means of our scholarship that we have honestly won." Then the first said, 'I know how to assemble the skeleton." The second said, "I can supply skin, flesh, and blood." The third said, 'I can give it life.” So the first assembled the skeleton, the second provided the skin, flesh, and blood. But while the third was intent on giving the breath of life, the man of sense advises against it, remarking, 'This is a lion. If you bring him to life, he will kill every one of us." "You simpleton!" said the other. "It is not I who will reduce scholarship nullity." "In that case," came the reply, wait a moment, while I climb this convenient tree." When this had been done, the lion was brought to life, rose up, and killed all three. But the man of sense, after the lion had gone elsewhere, climbed down and went home And that is why I say. Scholarship is less than sense; Therefore seek intelligence, Senseless scholars in their pride Made a lion, then they died. And this is the questions.?​</a>

Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</a>

                            10. What is the main idea of this text
Recent research on wealth and household finances seeks to blend neoclassical models with an understanding of real-world imperfections to answer questions about why some people save and others do not. This paper focuses on Baby Boomers standing on the verge of retirement, many of whom have saved little and will face financial insecurity in old age. The new 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement Study is invaluable for this first analysis of the financial situation of leading-edge Boomers, as it reports not only wealth levels but also information about respondents' planning behaviors and economic literacy. We show that the distribution of net worth among Early Baby Boomers is quite skewed, those in the 75th percentile had over 10 times the net worth ($400K) of households in the bottom 25th percentile ($37K). There is substantial heterogeneity in wealth within this cohort: the median high-school dropout had less than $23K in total net worth, while the median college graduate had over 10 times as much. Many Black and Hispanic Boomer households hold miniscule levels of wealth. Further, many in this cohort have accumulated little wealth outside their homes: at the mean, one third of the early Boomers' wealth is held in the form of home equity, and at the median the fraction is close to half. Since many members of this EBB cohort are reaching retirement with a substantial portion of their wealth in housing, they are particularly vulnerable to housing value shocks. By contrast, holders of stocks, IRAs, and business equity are concentrated in the top quartiles, Finally, we show that planning and economic literacy are important predictors of savings and investment success.</h2><br />

                            11. sa bawat paragraph hahanapin mo yung biased word tapos maggagawa ka ng explanation kung bakit yung bawat paragraph ay biasedParagraph 1: Amira is a girl whose ambition is to be a tour guide because of her love for her country. She believes that the Philippines is the best place to visit because of its peace-loving people, beautiful sceneries and great ambiance.Paragraph 2: Crying is an infant's natural way of communicating his/her mother. When a child cries, it only means something; either he/she is hungry, restless, uncomfortable, sleepy, or not feeling well. And this meaning is taken ordinarily by a mother's instinct. That is why everybody says that all mothers know best.Paragraph 3: Obedience is one of the virtues that is forgotten by the youth of this era. Because of this situation, it is believed that every child's foundation must be built at home seriously and later be honed by society.Paragraph 4: Roberto was born to a well-off family whose dedication to public service reaches the peak of the mountain. He became a politician in his town followinghis parents' foot steps when he was 25 and was awarded as one of the most out standing public servants during his time. The legacy he left became part of the town's history.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Paragraph 1:</p>Biased word: "best"Explanation: The word "best" is a biased word because it implies that the Philippines is superior to other countries as a tourist destination. While it is possible that Amira may have a personal preference for her home country, the statement does not acknowledge that different people may have different opinions about what makes a place the "best" to visit.<p></p><p>Paragraph 2:</p>Biased word: "all"Explanation: The word "all" is a biased word because it implies that every mother has an innate understanding of their child's needs through their crying. While it is true that mothers often develop a better understanding of their child's communication over time, not every mother may have the same level of intuition or experience.<p></p><p>Paragraph 3:</p>Biased word: "forgotten"Explanation: The word "forgotten" is a biased word because it implies that the youth of this era are entirely at fault for neglecting the virtue of obedience. It fails to consider external factors such as changing cultural values or societal pressures that may contribute to the lack of obedience in younger generations.<p></p><p>Paragraph 4:</p>Biased word: "outstanding"Explanation: The word "outstanding" is a biased word because it suggests that Roberto's public service was exceptional and noteworthy. While he may have been a good public servant, the statement does not provide any evidence or objective criteria to support the claim that he was "outstanding." Additionally, the statement portrays Roberto's family as dedicated to public service without acknowledging any potential biases or privileges that may have contributed to their success.<p></p><p></p><br />

                            19. Corona Virus Disease - 19 The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. We have now reached the tragic milestone of one million deaths, and the human family is suffering under an almost intolerable burden of loss. "The climbing dcath toll is staggering, and we must work together to slow the spread of this virus." - UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. But the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, it's also an unprecedented socio- economic crisis. Stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political effects that will leave deep and longstanding scars. UNDP is the technical lead in the UN's socio-economic recovery, alongside the health response, led by WHO, and the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and working under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinators. Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 400 million jobs could be lost. The World Bank projects a US$110 billion decline in remittances this year, which could mean 800 million people will not be able to meet their basic needs.(Retrieved from: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/coronavirus.html)​</h2><br />

he would still have experienced the same comforts had he
not encountered the magic tree? Explain your answer.
The story: 
The Adventures of Juan
Juan was always getting into trouble. He was a lazy boy, and more than that, he did not have good sense. When he tried to do things, he made such dreadful mistakes that he might better not have tried.
His family grew very impatient with him, scolding and beating him whenever he did anything wrong. One day his mother, who was almost discouraged with him, gave him a bolo[1] and sent him to the forest, for she thought he could at least cut firewood. Juan walked leisurely along, contemplating some means of escape. At last he came to a tree that seemed easy to cut, and then he drew his long knife and prepared to work.
Now it happened that this was a magic tree and it said to Juan:
"If you do not cut me I will give you a goat that shakes silver from its whiskers."
This pleased Juan wonderfully, both because he was curious to see the goat, and because he would not have to chop the wood. He agreed at once to spare the tree, whereupon the bark separated and a goat stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the money began to drop he was so delighted that he took the animal and started home to show his treasure to his mother.
On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when he heard of the boy's rich goat he decided to rob him. Knowing Juan's fondness for tuba[2] he persuaded him to drink, and while he was drunk, the friend substituted another goat for the magic one. As soon as he was sober again, Juan hastened home with the goat and told his people of the wonderful tree, but when he commanded the animal to shake its whiskers, no money fell out. The family, believing it to be another of Juan's tricks, beat and scolded the poor boy.
The went back to the tree and threatened to cut it down for lying to him, but the tree said :
"No, do not cut me down and I will give you a not which you may cast on dry ground, or even in the tree tops, and it will return full of fish."
So Juan spared the tree and started home with his precious net, but on the way he met the same friend who again persuaded him to drink tuba. While he was drunk, the friend replaced the magic net with a common one, so that when Juan reached home and tried to show his power, he was again the subject of ridicule.
Once more Juan went to his tree, this time determined to cut it down. But the offer of a magic pot, always full of rice and spoons which provided wbatever he wished to eat with his rice, dissuaded him, and he started home happier than ever. Before reaching home, however, he met with the same fate as before, and his folks, who were becoming tired of his pranks, beat him harder than ever.
Thoroughly angered, Juan sought the tree a fourth time and was on the point of cutting it down when once more it arrested his attention. After some discussion, he consented to accept a stick to which he had only to say, "Boombye, Boomba," and it would beat and kill anything he wished.
When he met his friend on this trip, he was asked what he had and he replied:
"Oh, it is only a stick, but if I say 'Boombye, Boomba' it will beat you to death."
At the sound of the magic words the stick leaped from his hands and began beating his friend until he cried:
"Oh, stop it and I will give back everything that I stole from you." Juan ordered the stick to stop, and then he compelled the man to lead the goat and to carry the net and the jar and spoons to his home.
There Juan commanded the goat, and it shook its whiskers until his mother and brothers had all the silver they could carry. Then they ate from the magic jar and spoons until they were filled. And this time Juan was not scolded. After they had finished Juan said:
"You have beaten me and scolded me all my life, and now you are glad to accept my good things. I am going to show you something else: "Boombye, Boomba'." Immediately the stick leaped out and beat them all until they begged for mercy and promised that Juan should ever after be head of the house.
From that time Juan was rich and powerful, but he never went anywhere without his stick. One night, when some thieves came to his house, he would have been robbed and killed had it not been for the magic words "Boombye, Boomba," which caused the death of all the robbers.
Some time after this he married a beautiful princess, and because of the kindness of the magic tree they always lived happily.[3]</h2><br />

                            27. LISTENING TEXT The Lion-Makers by Vishnu Sharma In a certain town were 4 Brahmans who lived in friendship. Three of them had reached the far shore of scholarship but lacked sense. The other found scholarship distasteful, he had nothing but sense. One day they met for consultation, "What is the use of attainments," they said, "if one does not travel, win the favour of kings, and acquire money? Whatever we do, let us all travel" But when they had gone a little way, the eldest of them said, 'One of us, the fourth, is a dullard having nothing but sense. Now nobody gains the favourable attention of kings by sense without scholarship. Therefore, we will not share our earnings with him. Let him tum back and go home." Then the second said, "My intelligent friend, you lack scholarship. Please go home." But the third said, "No, no. This is no way to behave. For we have played together since we were little boys. Come along, my noble friend. You shall have a share of the money we will eam." With this agreement, they continued their joumey, and in a forest found the bones of a dead lion. Thereupon one of them said, "A good opportunity to test the ripeness of our scholarship. Here lies some kind of creature, dead. Let us bring it to life by means of our scholarship that we have honestly won." Then the first said, 'I know how to assemble the skeleton." The second said, "I can supply skin, flesh, and blood." The third said, 'I can give it life.” So the first assembled the skeleton, the second provided the skin, flesh, and blood. But while the third was intent on giving the breath of life, the man of sense advises against it, remarking, 'This is a lion. If you bring him to life, he will kill every one of us." "You simpleton!" said the other. "It is not I who will reduce scholarship nullity." "In that case," came the reply, wait a moment, while I climb this convenient tree." When this had been done, the lion was brought to life, rose up, and killed all three. But the man of sense, after the lion had gone elsewhere, climbed down and went home And that is why I say. Scholarship is less than sense; Therefore seek intelligence, Senseless scholars in their pride Made a lion, then they died. And this is the questions.?​</h2><br />

                            28. What does this poem mean or say?
Essential Matters by Li Li
Let me count a few things that I can’t do without. In the past there were letters, so envelopes and post offices were essential. Then, there must be doves, a cool breeze, reveries, and a backdrop of dusk on my way to the post office. A place to say farewell was essential when it’s time to leave home; there was a ticket in my hand, him at the windy train station, tears in our eyes, and the satisfaction running down my body as I turned around. Reaching middle-age, children nearby and healthy parents are essential, so are the lovely words on the pages I turn, and the scents of the fruits that he brought to the room. Finally, the peach flowers that bloom overnight, if you smell the sweet-scented ghosts under the trees, please know they are my family who left this world too early.</h2><br />

                            30. Section: Apple A. (Module 1) Directions. Based on the song you have listened to entitled RISE UP by Andra Day, identify the appropriate solutions for the problems listed below. Choose the correct answer from the pool of solutions below. Write the LETTER of the correct answer on the space provided before each number. 1. You're unhealthy. Our health has become a real problem. We wonder why we feel tired, sick and get headaches. We'll all experience health challenges at some point in our life. 2. Every day feels the same. You wake up. You eat. You go to work. You eat. You come home. You eat. You go to bed. 3. You didn't reach your goal. Just because you set a goal, doesn't mean you're going to get it. Many of life's toughest goals take lots of attempts. 4. Someone criticized you. If you want to make a dent in this world, then the critics will come out of the closet. The bigger your aspirations are, the more you'll be criticized. 5. A fear is standing in your way. There are so many common fears — fear of spiders, flying, public speaking, dying, career change, heights and maybe even a fear of expressing yourself. ​</h2><br />
