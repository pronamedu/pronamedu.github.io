The area where there is an observed decrease in the thickness of the ozone layer is called an ozone hole. 7. As the ozone layer gets thinner, the protective filter activity of the atmosphere is progressively reduced. Consequently, the people and the environment are exposed to higher levels of UV radiation, especially UVB. Exposure to UVB radiation is linked with increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts, as well as damage to plants and manne ecosystems. 8. However, most evidence now suggests that the major cause for the increased cancer rates is altered behavior rather than ozone depletion. Raised awareness and changes in life-style are urgently needed to alter ongoing trends. 9. As the mercury rises, the climate can change in unexpected ways. In addition to sea levels rising, weather can become more extreme. This means more intense major storms, more rain followed by longer and drier droughts-a challenge for growing crops-changes in the ranges in which plants and animals can live, and loss of water supplies that have historically come from glaciers. 10. The life story of a butterfly begins from an egg. The egg hatches into a caterpillar. The caterpillar, or what is more scientifically termed a larva, stuffs itself with leaves, growing plumper and longer through a series of molts in which it sheds its skin. One day, the caterpillar stops eating, hangs upside down from a twig or leaf 6​</a>

The area where there is an observed decreasein the thickness of the ozone layer is called an ozone hole.7. As the ozone layer gets thinner, the protective filter activity of the atmosphere isprogressively reduced. Consequently, the people and the environment are exposedto higher levels of UV radiation, especially UVB. Exposure to UVB radiation is linkedwith increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts, as well as damage to plants andmarine ecosystems.8. However, most evidence now suggests that the major cause for the increasedcancer rates is altered behavior rather than ozone depletion. Raised awareness andchanges in life-style are urgently needed to alter ongoing trends.9. As the mercury rises, the climate can change in unexpected ways. In addition tosea levels rising, weather can become more extreme. This means more intensemajor storms, more rain followed by longer and drier droughts-a challenge forgrowing crops-changes in the ranges in which plants and animals can live, and lossof water supplies that have historically come from glaciers.10. The life story of a butterfly begins from an egg. The egg hatches into acaterpillar. The caterpillar, or what is more scientifically termed a larva, stuffs itselfwith leaves, growing plumper and longer through a series of molts in which it shedsits skin. One day, the caterpillar stops eating, hangs upside down from a twig or leaf6​</a>

The area where there is an observed decrease in the thickness of the ozone layer is called an ozone hole. 7. As the ozone layer gets thinner, the protective filter activity of the atmosphere is progressively reduced. Consequently, the people and the environment are exposed to higher levels of UV radiation, especially UVB. Exposure to UVB radiation is linked with increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts, as well as damage to plants and manne ecosystems. 8. However, most evidence now suggests that the major cause for the increased cancer rates is altered behavior rather than ozone depletion. Raised awareness and changes in life-style are urgently needed to alter ongoing trends. 9. As the mercury rises, the climate can change in unexpected ways. In addition to sea levels rising, weather can become more extreme. This means more intense major storms, more rain followed by longer and drier droughts-a challenge for growing crops-changes in the ranges in which plants and animals can live, and loss of water supplies that have historically come from glaciers. 10. The life story of a butterfly begins from an egg. The egg hatches into a caterpillar. The caterpillar, or what is more scientifically termed a larva, stuffs itself with leaves, growing plumper and longer through a series of molts in which it sheds its skin. One day, the caterpillar stops eating, hangs upside down from a twig or leaf 6​</h2><br />

Our Sun is a late-generation star, incorporating the debris from many generations of earlier stars, and it and the Solar System around it form roughly 4.5 to 5 billion years ago (8.5 to 9 billion years after the Big Bang). 2. The temperature of the universe falls to the point (about a billion degrees) where automatic nuclei can begin to form as protons and neutrons combine through nuclear fusion to form the nuclei of the simple elements of hydrogen, helium and lithium. 3. Triggered by the separation of the strong nuclear force, the universe undergoes an extremely rapid exponential expansion. 4. 5. The period after the formation of the first atoms and before the first stars. In this era, a gravitational singularity before this time and it is hypothesized that the four fundamental forces all have the same strength, and are possibly even unified into one fundamental force. 6. It is a phenomenon where electromagnetic radiation (such as light) from an object undergoes an increase in wavelength. It is a form of energy that affects the universe on the largest scales. It is a form of matter thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. 7. 8. 9. It is the increase in distance between any two given gravitationally unbound parts of the observable universe with time. 10. It is the remnant from an early stage of the universe also known as "relic radiation".​</h2><br />

Scientists have discovered that the ozone layer located just above Antarctica inthe South Pole is already damaged. The area where there is an observed decreasein the thickness of the ozone layer is called an ozone hole.7. As the ozone layer gets thinner, the protective filter activity of the atmosphere isprogressively reduced. Consequently, the people and the environment are exposedto higher levels of UV radiation, especially UVB. Exposure to UVB radiation is linkedwith increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts, as well as damage to plants andmarine ecosystems.8. However, most evidence now suggests that the major cause for the increasedcancer rates is altered behavior rather than ozone depletion. Raised awareness andchanges in life-style are urgently needed to alter ongoing trends.9. As the mercury rises, the climate can change in unexpected ways. In addition tosea levels rising, weather can become more extreme. This means more intensemajor storms, more rain followed by longer and drier droughts-a challenge forgrowing crops-changes in the ranges in which plants and animals can live, and lossof water supplies that have historically come from glaciers.10. The life story of a butterfly begins from an egg. The egg hatches into acaterpillar. The caterpillar, or what is more scientifically termed a larva, stuffs itselfwith leaves, growing plumper and longer through a series of molts in which it shedsits skin. One day, the caterpillar stops eating, hangs upside down from a twig or leaf6​</h2><br />
