                        4. Distance around the park = 4 sides x 4 light posts x 10 meters = 160 meters <br />5. Fence measurement = sum of all sides = 5 + 7 + 10 + 15 = 37 meters <br />6. Base length = (perimeter - 2 x equal side length) / 2 = (55 - 2 x 17) / 2 = 10.5 cm <br />7. Perimeter of each rectangle = perimeter of square / 4 = 48 / 4 = 12 cm <br />8. Perimeter of kite = 4 x side length = 4 x 15 = 60 cm <br />9. Perimeter of big square = 9 x perimeter of small square = 9 x 20 = 180 cm <br />10.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4. The distance around the square park would be the perimeter of the square formed by the light posts. Since there are 4 light posts along each side of the park, and the distance between the light posts is 10 meters, the perimeter of the square park would be 4 times the distance between the light posts, which is 4 * 10 = 40 meters.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>5. The measurement of the fence which surrounds Tina's garden would be the perimeter of the trapezoid. The formula for calculating the perimeter of a trapezoid is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the sides of the trapezoid are 5 meters, 7 meters, 10 meters, and 15 meters, so the perimeter would be 5 + 7 + 10 + 15 = 37 meters.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>6. The perimeter of an isosceles triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides. In this case, the perimeter is given as 55 cm, and one of the equal sides is 17 cm. Since the triangle is isosceles, the other equal side would also be 17 cm. So the total length of the two equal sides would be 17 + 17 = 34 cm. Since the perimeter is given as 55 cm, and the sum of the lengths of the equal sides is 34 cm, the length of the base can be calculated by subtracting the sum of the equal sides from the perimeter: 55 - 34 = 21 cm.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>7. If a square is cut into 4 identical rectangles, the perimeter of each rectangle would be half of the perimeter of the original square. Since the perimeter of the square is given as 48 cm, the perimeter of each rectangle would be 48 / 2 = 24 cm.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>8. The perimeter of the square kite made by combining two equilateral triangular colored papers would be the sum of the lengths of all four sides of the kite. Since each side of the equilateral triangle has a length of 15 cm, the perimeter of the square kite would be 4 * 15 = 60 cm.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>9. If nine identical small squares are put together to form a bigger square, the perimeter of the big square would be the sum of the lengths of all four sides of the big square. Since the perimeter of each small square is given as 20 cm, the perimeter of the big square would be 9 times the perimeter of each small square, which is 9 * 20 = 180 cm.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>10. Joey bought a square lot with a side measurement of 80 m. When he divided it into two equal parts, each resulting lot would be a square with a side measurement of half of the original square, which is 80 / 2 = 40 m. Since the remaining lot is a square, the perimeter of the remaining lot would be 4 times the length of one side, which is 4 * 40 = 160 m.</strong></p><br />
