                                            3. I was nervous about going to Pat's birthday party that day. I was afraid that there was no one there that I knew of and I did not want to be left out of place, especially then that I expected Pat would be busy with her guests so I said to Mother, "Mother, I do not want to go the party)". My mother furrowed her brow and said, "What is wrong with you, Debbie? We made a promise to Pat that we would be there. In fact, we already have the present and we need to give that to her". But I shook my head hard; I still would not want to go. At last, Mother put her hands on mine and I could not do anything. THEME: POINT OF VIEW: 4. Jon-jon examined his mathematics book. It had been badly treated. The cover was torn and some pages were missing. Still, Jon-jon was convinced that looks were less important than utility. He had learned that lesson long ago. "Thanks, Mr. Castor". He said with gratitude. Mr. Castor looked up from his desk and said, "Sorry, we do not have new books yet, but there's plenty of good math left in that book."Mr. Thompson smiled that Jon-jon fell appreciative. THEME: POINT OF VIEW: 5. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hands and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will be probably feel happy that you are actively taking part in the lesson. THEME: POINT OFVIEW:​</a>

                            8. 3. I was nervous about going to Pat's birthday party that day. I was afraid that there was no one there that I knew of and I did not want to be left out of place, especially then that I expected Pat would be busy with her guests so I said to Mother, "Mother, I do not want to go the party)". My mother furrowed her brow and said, "What is wrong with you, Debbie? We made a promise to Pat that we would be there. In fact, we already have the present and we need to give that to her". But I shook my head hard; I still would not want to go. At last, Mother put her hands on mine and I could not do anything. THEME: POINT OF VIEW: 4. Jon-jon examined his mathematics book. It had been badly treated. The cover was torn and some pages were missing. Still, Jon-jon was convinced that looks were less important than utility. He had learned that lesson long ago. "Thanks, Mr. Castor". He said with gratitude. Mr. Castor looked up from his desk and said, "Sorry, we do not have new books yet, but there's plenty of good math left in that book."Mr. Thompson smiled that Jon-jon fell appreciative. THEME: POINT OF VIEW: 5. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hands and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will be probably feel happy that you are actively taking part in the lesson. THEME: POINT OFVIEW:​</h2><br />
