                            6. As the Earth moves around the sun, all countries will receive sunlight during daytime and the absence of light towards the Earth may result in nighttime. What is the main reason why some countries experience four seasons?
Select one:
a. The moon is pulling the Earth which results in sudden changes in season and weather.
b. The tilt of the Earth influences the unequal distribution of sunlight in the polar regions.
c. The movement of the Earth around the moons of other planets fosters the occurrence of seasonal changes.
d. The solar wind moves the Earth at different angles to produce typhoons in different areas and sunlight in some areas.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The four seasons happen because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. At different times of the year, the sun's rays hit different parts of the globe more directly. The angle of the Earth's axis tilts the Northern Hemisphere towards the sun during the summer. Without the tilt of the earth's axis, we wouldn't have seasons.</p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>5. </strong><strong>If the Earth's axis was not tilted we would have one season</strong><strong>. There would be 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness. In the summer, the North pole gets 24 hours/day of sunlight. ... The seasons are reversed because when one hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, the other is tilted away.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>6.</strong><strong> It is very impossible for the Philippines to have the four seasons, namely spring, winter, summer and fall.</strong><strong> But if the climate is changing because of the greenhouse effect then maybe it is possible. But with the location of the Philippines which is at the equator then it would be impossible.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>7.</strong><strong> The country I would most likely want to visit is: Switzerland</strong><strong>. This country is best defined by its natural beauty and geography. Switzerland is surrounded by Germany, Austria, Italy and France, all great destinations.
