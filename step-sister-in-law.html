                                            Isis and OsirisA long time ago, the god Osiris came to Egypt to rule as king. He brought theEgyptian people new laws and taught them how to farm well and live peacefulty in theirvillages. Osiris was a very wise and powerful king and was loved and respected by theEgyptian people. Unfortunately, his brother Seth, was very jealous of his brother's power inEgypt, and began to form a plan to kill Osiris and take over his throne.Late one night, Seth tiptoed into Osiris's bedroom. Careful to not wake up Osins, ohis queen, the goddess, Isis, Seth measured Osiris's body from top to bottom and from sideto side. The next morning, Seth took the measurements to a carpenter who made a beautifuwooden chesi decorated with bright paint and sheets of gold.That night, Seth threw a huge party, and invited Osiris as the guest of honor. Thenight was spent feasting, singing, dancing, and playing games. For the final game, Sesbrought out the huge wooden chest. He announced that the first person to fit perfectly intothe chest would be allowed to keep it.One by one, each of Seth's friends climbed into the chest Unsurprisingly, no onewas able to fit into the chest, which was made perfectly for Osiris.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Judgement of Solomon is a story from the Hebrew Bible in which Solomon ruled between two women both claiming to be the mother of a child. Solomon revealed their true feelings and relationship to the child by suggesting the baby be cut in two, each woman to receive half. With this strategy, he was able to discern the non-mother as the woman who entirely approved of this proposal, while the actual mother begged that the sword might be sheathed and the child committed to the care of her rival. Some consider this approach to justice an archetypal example of an impartial judge displaying wisdom in making a ruling.</p><br />

Osiris was a very wise and powerful king and was loved and respected by theEgyptian people. Unfortunately, his brother Seth, was very jealous of his brother's power inEgypt, and began to form a plan to kill Osiris and take over his throne.Late one night, Seth tiptoed into Osiris's bedroom. Careful to not wake up Osins, ohis queen, the goddess, Isis, Seth measured Osiris's body from top to bottom and from sideto side. The next morning, Seth took the measurements to a carpenter who made a beautifuwooden chesi decorated with bright paint and sheets of gold.That night, Seth threw a huge party, and invited Osiris as the guest of honor. Thenight was spent feasting, singing, dancing, and playing games. For the final game, Sesbrought out the huge wooden chest.
