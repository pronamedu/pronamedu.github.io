This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning. However, making language learning effective and efficient,considering learners' diversity, personality, behavior, intelligence and otherequally important factorsfactors still remains quite challenging for languageprofessionalsPIVOT 4A CALABARZON23​</a>

This is in consonance with the findings of variousstudies on bilingualism. McCabe et al., (2013) found a reasonable basis from thegrowing population of bilinguals in the world to affirm that learning using twolanguages does not lead to confusion or difficulty in an academic environment.The mentioned studies zoom in the starting phase of languagedevelopment wherein most factors that affect language learning are externallyproduced or the physical language environment. It can be pointed out that thesituation where a learner is raised and the people who surround him havebearing in the failure or success of language acquisition, training, and learning.Considering these factors beyond the school, the actual teaching-learningenvironment, language teachers indeed have a very serious job to work out.It is undeniable that there is voluminous input available about languageteaching and learning. However, making language learning effective and efficient,considering learners' diversity, personality, behavior, intelligence and otherequally important factorsfactors still remains quite challenging for languageprofessionalsPIVOT 4A CALABARZON23​</h2><br />

1. The footsteps were coming closer. I knew I had to get out of there fast. Looking desperately around, I finally spotted a small window at the end of the room, a beacon of light in the dark, rancid basement. I sprinted and leapt up to grab a ceiling pipe. Thankfully, the pipe was close enough to the window to allow me to swing my body through. My enemy was making his way down the hall, bursting open door after door. I needed to break through this window in two tries to make it out in time.

Almost all the good jobs today involve science, engineering, and technology. And there is such a demand for workers with your skills that you can choose from thousands of jobs.
