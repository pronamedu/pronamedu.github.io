                                            In 1993, friends Marty Aquino and Jon Perez sought to set up a food cart business in the country. Based on their travel experiences, they decided that nachos-crispy chips that were typically dipped in a salsa-would be a viable product to offer as these were becoming increasingly available across the United States. These are often being of fered in places such as convenience stores, supermarkets, skating rinks, ski lodges, airports, and pubs. The question that their product will have to answer is, will Filipi- nos be as interested in nachos the same way that Americans have been growing in- creasingly fond of it?Adapting the flavors of their nachos to suit Filipino tastes, they soon created a food cart concept along with branding, packaging, and cart design. Their first cart was set up at SM City North Edsa in Quezon City, where it was located next to the movie thea- ters. Regular sized nachos were servings of 100 grams, topped with hot melted cheese. Additional toppings such as salsa, ground beef, and chili con carne were also available at a small add-on price for each toppings.Their first cart became a success. Duly inspired, Marty and Jon proceeded to open a second branch at the theater area of SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City. Soon, the new business was opening even more branches.Not all branches were doing well though. A cart at Robinson's Galleria mall in Pasig City, situated on the ground floor alongside other food carts, gave middling reve- nues. A cart at the Shangri-La Mall that was also situated next to other food carts on the ground floor delivered average performance. The same was observed with their cart in V-Mall at the Greenhills Commercial Center in Mandaluyong that was also situ- ated on the ground floor alongside other food carts.Then there were the problematic carts. At Ever Goteso Mall their cart was located next to the supermarket checkout. It was a mall that catered to the broad market, so there was a lot of foot traffic. However, few people paid attention to the nacho cart. The same was observed in their cart at the Tutuban Mall, a very populist mall in old Manila. Despite of the very heavy foot traffic, their cart that was at the entrance of supermarket was hardly patronized.Guide Question: 1. Identify the external factors that affects the Gourmet Nachos.

"Family planning to mitigate effects of inflation' "The size of the family really affects the basic needs if the prices continue to rise up," Popcom Deputy Executive Director Lolito Tocardon said on the sidelines of the Regional Population Management Congress held Wednesday in this city. Based on the July 2018 study of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), about half of the average Filipino family's monthly income is spent on food."Having a big family will be vulnerable to poverty because their needs also increase while their income cannot answer their needs." Tocardon said. Based on the article, what are the negative effects of high economic inflation to a big family?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> A big family will be hungrier since their income will not be enough anymore to support their daily needs.

                            20. In 1993, friends Marty Aquino and Jon Perez sought to set up a food cart business in the country. Based on their travel experiences, they decided that nachos-crispy chips that were typically dipped in a salsa-would be a viable product to offer as these were becoming increasingly available across the United States. These are often being of fered in places such as convenience stores, supermarkets, skating rinks, ski lodges, airports, and pubs. The question that their product will have to answer is, will Filipi- nos be as interested in nachos the same way that Americans have been growing in- creasingly fond of it?Adapting the flavors of their nachos to suit Filipino tastes, they soon created a food cart concept along with branding, packaging, and cart design. Their first cart was set up at SM City North Edsa in Quezon City, where it was located next to the movie thea- ters. Regular sized nachos were servings of 100 grams, topped with hot melted cheese. Additional toppings such as salsa, ground beef, and chili con carne were also available at a small add-on price for each toppings.Their first cart became a success. Duly inspired, Marty and Jon proceeded to open a second branch at the theater area of SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City. Soon, the new business was opening even more branches.Not all branches were doing well though. A cart at Robinson's Galleria mall in Pasig City, situated on the ground floor alongside other food carts, gave middling reve- nues. A cart at the Shangri-La Mall that was also situated next to other food carts on the ground floor delivered average performance. The same was observed with their cart in V-Mall at the Greenhills Commercial Center in Mandaluyong that was also situ- ated on the ground floor alongside other food carts.Then there were the problematic carts. At Ever Goteso Mall their cart was located next to the supermarket checkout. It was a mall that catered to the broad market, so there was a lot of foot traffic. However, few people paid attention to the nacho cart. The same was observed in their cart at the Tutuban Mall, a very populist mall in old Manila. Despite of the very heavy foot traffic, their cart that was at the entrance of supermarket was hardly patronized.Guide Question: 1. Identify the external factors that affects the Gourmet Nachos. Use PESTLE Analysis?​</h2><br />
