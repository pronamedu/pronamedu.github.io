                                            Hi my name is Carmen Winstead. I'm 17 years old. I am very similar to you... Did I mention to you that I'm dead. A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me. When I didn't come back up the police came. The girls said that I had fell and everyone believed them. The police found my body in the sewer. I had a broken neck and my face was torn off. Send this message to 15 people after you read the whole message if you value your life! A boy called David received this message. He just laughed and deleted it. When he was in the shower he heard laughing... MY LAUGHTER! He got really scared, rushed to his phone to repost this message... But he was too late. The next morning his mum entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying, "You will never have him back!" No one has found his body yet... because he is with me!... Send this to 15 people in the next 5 minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's.​</a>

Also, give the paragraph a catchy title. Both children and adults love to celebrate the Holiday season. Childrendo not go to school. Adults get a few days off from work. Children love to sing lively songs. Adults listen to the children when they sing. Children receive cool gifts from children’s parents, friends, and they also receive presents from other relatives. The children also give the people simple yet nice presents. Receiving gifts make adults happy, too. Adults receive more money during holiday season. They receive holiday bonuses. Adults are more capable to buy gifts for the people they love. They can even give the special people in their lives fancy gifts even if they don’t really have to give fancy gifts. Holiday season is a great season. People show love. People show kindness. People show generosity. Enemies, young and old, become friends. It’s a wonderfulcelebration. It is worth celebrating.​</a>

I Decree: I dwell in the midst of Infinite Abundance. The Abundance of God is my Infinite Source. The River of Life never stops flowing. It flows through me into lavish expression. Good comes to me through unexpected avenues and God works in a myriad of ways to bless me. I now open my mind to receive my good. Nothing is too good to be true. Nothing is too wonderful to have happen. With God as my Source, nothing amazes me. I Am not burdened by thoughts of past or future. One is gone. The other is yet to come. By the power of my belief, coupled with my purposeful fearless actions and my deep rapport with God, my future is created and my abundance made manifest. I ask and accept that I am lifted in this and every moment into Higher Truth. My mind is quiet. From this day forward I give freely and fearlessly into life and Life gives back to me with magnificent increase. Blessings come in expected and unexpected ways. God provides for me in wondrous ways. I AM indeed grateful. And I let it be so.​</a>

I'm sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although you have indeed been called.
You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.
But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.
And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, I am nearby.
This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you.
For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.
My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you.
I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.
It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms.
This ends for all of us.

                                            One Moment at Recess
by: Grace S. Ponce
            It was 10:00 in the morning at Mabuhay Elementary School. It’s time to take a snack, it was recess time. Pupils are line up in waiting for their turns to go inside the canteen. Out of the crowd, Joselito seems down at the bench just looking around the kids eating and some are playing. He had to money to buy something because his father did not receive his salary yet. His mother told him to have a heavy breakfast for him to be full until lunch time. While waiting for the time to pass by, he suddenly saw fifty pesos on the ground. He said to himself, “If I spend this money, I will be able to have a lots to eat for recess.” But he knows that it is not the right thing to do. So, he goes to their classroom and asks for help from his adviser to find the owner of that money. It so happens that one of his classmates Irene was crying at the corner of their classroom because she lost her money. Joselito asks Irene how much she lost. “It’s fifty pesos”, said Irene. Joselito gives the fifty pesos that he saw to Irene and said, “I think it’s yours,” Irene was so thankful to Joselito. As a form of her appreciation, she told Joselito to go to the canteen with her and they shared snacks for recess. Joselito was grateful that because of his honesty, he was able to enjoy his recess time.

I regret missing the chance to witness the silent pride in hermisty eyes as each one of her children walked across the stage toreceive his or her hard-earned and well-deserved diploma. Yet, I cansee her expressions vividly. Is it because of my mother's cleardescription when she recounted the family struggles? No, I must haveseen that look in my grandmother eyes myself. It was last week whenI told I was graduating as class valedictorian. Her response wassimply to take me in her arms and whisper, "Keep up the tradition ofacademic excellence."4.

                            5. Hi my name is Carmen Winstead. I'm 17 years old. I am very similar to you... Did I mention to you that I'm dead. A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me. When I didn't come back up the police came. The girls said that I had fell and everyone believed them. The police found my body in the sewer. I had a broken neck and my face was torn off. Send this message to 15 people after you read the whole message if you value your life! A boy called David received this message. He just laughed and deleted it. When he was in the shower he heard laughing... MY LAUGHTER! He got really scared, rushed to his phone to repost this message... But he was too late. The next morning his mum entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying, "You will never have him back!" No one has found his body yet... because he is with me!... Send this to 15 people in the next 5 minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's.​</h2><br />

The children also give the people simple yet nice presents. Receiving gifts make adults happy, too. Adults receive more money during holiday season. They receive holiday bonuses. Adults are more capable to buy gifts for the people they love. They can even give the special people in their lives fancy gifts even if they don’t really have to give fancy gifts. Holiday season is a great season. People show love. People show kindness. People show generosity. Enemies, young and old, become friends. It’s a wonderfulcelebration.

Good comes to me through unexpected avenues and God works in a myriad of ways to bless me. I now open my mind to receive my good. Nothing is too good to be true. Nothing is too wonderful to have happen. With God as my Source, nothing amazes me. I Am not burdened by thoughts of past or future. One is gone. The other is yet to come. By the power of my belief, coupled with my purposeful fearless actions and my deep rapport with God, my future is created and my abundance made manifest. I ask and accept that I am lifted in this and every moment into Higher Truth. My mind is quiet. From this day forward I give freely and fearlessly into life and Life gives back to me with magnificent increase. Blessings come in expected and unexpected ways. God provides for me in wondrous ways. I AM indeed grateful. And I let it be so.​</h2><br />

                            17. Connection terminated.
I'm sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although you have indeed been called.
You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.
But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.
And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, I am nearby.
This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you.
For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.
My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you.
I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.
It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms.
This ends for all of us.

                            25. One Moment at Recess
by: Grace S. Ponce
            It was 10:00 in the morning at Mabuhay Elementary School. It’s time to take a snack, it was recess time. Pupils are line up in waiting for their turns to go inside the canteen. Out of the crowd, Joselito seems down at the bench just looking around the kids eating and some are playing. He had to money to buy something because his father did not receive his salary yet. His mother told him to have a heavy breakfast for him to be full until lunch time. While waiting for the time to pass by, he suddenly saw fifty pesos on the ground. He said to himself, “If I spend this money, I will be able to have a lots to eat for recess.” But he knows that it is not the right thing to do. So, he goes to their classroom and asks for help from his adviser to find the owner of that money. It so happens that one of his classmates Irene was crying at the corner of their classroom because she lost her money. Joselito asks Irene how much she lost. “It’s fifty pesos”, said Irene. Joselito gives the fifty pesos that he saw to Irene and said, “I think it’s yours,” Irene was so thankful to Joselito. As a form of her appreciation, she told Joselito to go to the canteen with her and they shared snacks for recess. Joselito was grateful that because of his honesty, he was able to enjoy his recess time.

Yet, I cansee her expressions vividly. Is it because of my mother's cleardescription when she recounted the family struggles? No, I must haveseen that look in my grandmother eyes myself.
