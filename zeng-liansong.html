                                            My Thai CatBy Pratoomratha ZengA Siamese cat was given by a friend of Zeng's father. Zeng named the cat, Sli Sward.Zeng recalled the time when his cat was elected by the villagers as the Rain Queenbecause of what the cat did during the drought in 1925.There was a time when the villagers were so desperate for rain. So, they performed theold Brahmo-Buddhist rain ceremony called the Nang Maaw, the queen of the cats. Thisceremony had been performed by the peasants since time immemorial. However, nothinghappenedOne day, an old lady visited Zeng's father to ask Sii Sward's help for rain. At first, Zengwas hesitant because he thought that Sii Sward might be killed for an offering. As atradition, to refuse the will or command of the father was a grave sin. Fortunately, his fatherunderstood Zeng's feeling. So, he did not let the Siamese cat die for an offering.Nevertheless, they continued the ceremony. Sii Sward was put inside the cage and wasapplied with perfume. The cat misbehaved but was later calmed down when Zengapproached it. During the ceremony, the cat fell asleep. The villagers offered their chantuntil the Siamese cat fell asleep for three days. Then days went by, rain fell. Since then,Sii Sward was elected as the Rain Queen of their village.haping InterpretationWhat is the story all about?How did Sii Sward become instrumental in praying for rain?Do we have the same practice of worshipping here in the Philippines?How do we Filipinos and Thais regard cats?In what ways are Filipinos similar to or different from the Thais in terms of prayingor worshipping?​</a>

                            9. what does the disciple of Confucius asked himself everyday? Who is the "Master" to whom the disciple Zeng Zi refers?​</h2><br />
                        The character of the noble man, in contrast to the sage, is being taught as a tangible model for all in the here and now. And although many descriptions of the requirements for junzi status seem quite out of our reach, there are many passages where Confucius labels a contemporary, or one of his disciples a “noble man,” intending a complement. Thus, the categorization is not so rigid. One might want to compare the term “noble man” to the Buddhist bodhisattva, in that both are the models for the tradition, both indicate a very high stage of human development as technical terms, yet both may be used colloquially to refer to a “really good person.”<br />

                            14. What are the three things we need to reflect on each day, according to master zeng​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: 1. It helps you learn from your mistakes. If we don’t reflect on our mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them. And that’s not very smart. However, if we reflect on those mistakes, figure out what went wrong, see how we can prevent them in the future, we can use our mistakes to get better. Mistakes, then, are a valuable learning tool, instead of something to feel embarrassed or upset about. Reflection is an important way to do that. 2. It gives you great ideas. Like I said, every single post idea that I have for Zen Habits (or other blogs I write for) comes from reflection. Basically, I reflect on things that I’m doing or that are going on in my life. If things aren’t going well, I learn stuff I can share with others. If I reflect on something that’s a success for me, I think about how I got that success, and share that too. I’ve had hundreds of great ideas this year from reflection. 3. It helps you help others. The ideas I get for posts are not just things I feel like writing about … they’re ways that I can share what I’ve learned to help others going through the same things. And this year, I’ve learned just how powerful that is. I began the year with the hope that some of the things I’ve learned in the past couple years can help others … and I’m ending the year with the profound realization of how such simple little tips can change people’s lives. I’ve had hundreds of emails from readers who tell me how little tips, like how to wake up early, or how to start the exercise habit, have changed their lives. That’s incredible. I’m overjoyed if I help people or inspire them.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: eto po.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            23. My Thai CatBy Pratoomratha ZengA Siamese cat was given by a friend of Zeng's father. Zeng named the cat, Sli Sward.Zeng recalled the time when his cat was elected by the villagers as the Rain Queenbecause of what the cat did during the drought in 1925.There was a time when the villagers were so desperate for rain. So, they performed theold Brahmo-Buddhist rain ceremony called the Nang Maaw, the queen of the cats. Thisceremony had been performed by the peasants since time immemorial. However, nothinghappenedOne day, an old lady visited Zeng's father to ask Sii Sward's help for rain. At first, Zengwas hesitant because he thought that Sii Sward might be killed for an offering. As atradition, to refuse the will or command of the father was a grave sin. Fortunately, his fatherunderstood Zeng's feeling. So, he did not let the Siamese cat die for an offering.Nevertheless, they continued the ceremony. Sii Sward was put inside the cage and wasapplied with perfume. The cat misbehaved but was later calmed down when Zengapproached it. During the ceremony, the cat fell asleep. The villagers offered their chantuntil the Siamese cat fell asleep for three days. Then days went by, rain fell. Since then,Sii Sward was elected as the Rain Queen of their village.haping InterpretationWhat is the story all about?How did Sii Sward become instrumental in praying for rain?Do we have the same practice of worshipping here in the Philippines?How do we Filipinos and Thais regard cats?In what ways are Filipinos similar to or different from the Thais in terms of prayingor worshipping?​</h2><br />
