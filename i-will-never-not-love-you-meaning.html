                                            I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war? In times of peace? 7-10. Make believe that you are one of the following: (a. teacher b. policeman c. doctor d. businessman) How can you show that you are a true Filipino in terms of solving community and national problems? ​</a>

                                            What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</a>

                                            Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5.

                                            THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

                                            The Martyr Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry After all, at some point in your life That love was the most important thing to you, That love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, That love made you believe that destiny does exist, And that love made you question, Why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't even think twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, I was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, Just so I could be with you. All I ever did was care for you. All I ever did was to make you happy. And all I ever did was love you. Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry But I needed to ask forgiveness from the one who was hurt the most… Myself 1. what is the imagery of the poem? 2. what is the mood of the poem?​</a>

                            4. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war?

                            5. What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</h2><br />

Let me desire You in my seekingLet me find You by my loving You now.Let me love You when I find You.Teach me, Lord. Teach my heart where and how to find You.                                                           1.what do you think is the meaning behind the song?                                                2 What line you find very interesting? why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>In truth, I think the meaning of the song, is that whoever was singing this, wanted to seek and find God. They state in a few verses that he/she was made by God, and yet, they have never seen him. They ask of God to teach him/her how to find him, to seek him. They state that they cannot see him, unless he teaches them, or that they cannot find him unless he shows himself to them. They want to love God when they find him, and they want him to teach their hearts on how to find him.</strong></p><p><strong>The line that I found interesting was:</strong></p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>Teach my heart where to find You, for I cannot see You unless You teach me, or find You unless You show yourself to me."</strong></p><p><strong>I found it interesting because it shows that no matter how hard we try, only God can show himself. No amount of will and force can make God show himself to us. It is him we need to find, not the other way around. We are not the ones who will show ourselves to him, but rather, he would show himself to us.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The figurative language used in the lyrics is:</p><p></p><p>Simile: "I'm in a field of dandelions, wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine." - This is a simile because it uses the word "like" to compare being in a field of dandelions to the act of wishing on every one of them, implying that the person's desire for the other person is as abundant as the dandelions in the field.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime, and I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the rarity of finding true love by saying it only comes once in a lifetime, implying that the person believes the other person is their one true love.</p><p></p><p>Metaphor: "Dandelion, into the wind you go, won't you let my darling know?" - This is a metaphor because it compares a dandelion being blown by the wind to the act of conveying a message to the person's "darling." It implies that the person is hoping the message reaches their loved one just like a dandelion disperses its seeds through the wind.</p><p></p><p>Personification: "I see forever in your eyes" - This is personification because it gives human qualities, such as seeing forever, to the eyes of the person the lyrics are addressed to. It implies a deep emotional connection and suggests that the person's eyes hold a sense of eternity.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "I've never felt so alive and free, when you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the intensity of the person's feelings when the other person is looking at them. It implies that their happiness and sense of freedom are greatly amplified in the presence of the other person.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Glad to help ^^ </p><p>pa brainly if you don't mind </p><p></p><br />

                            15. Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2.

The speaker reflects on the past seven months and seven years of their life, and how they have come to realize the heavy weight of responsibility that comes with being an adult in a tough and sometimes mad world. They have learned that many of the things they were taught about love, success, and goals were just lies, and that they now have a hollow soul. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that they now know the reality of being an adult, and that they must face it head on, even if they don't know where to go from here.</p><br />

                            22. THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

And promised three words you know you'll never meet Remember when I believed You meant it when you said it first to me? And now I'm pickin' her apart Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart But she's beautiful, she looks kind She probably gives you butterflies - [Chorus] I hope you're happy But not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy I wish you all the best, really Say you love her, baby Just not like you loved me And think of me fondly when your hands are on her I hope you're happy, but don't be happier - [Bridge] Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh - [Chorus] I hope you're happy Just not like how you were with me I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go So find someone great, but don't find no one better I hope you're happy but don't be happier​                                   -Olivia Rodrigo​</h2><br />
