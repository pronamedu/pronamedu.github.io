 The dead girl, beautiful and peaceful in death, her scarlet lips slightly
parted as though whispering caress to her lover, her blue eyes gentle and
unquestioning as a baby, lay in the murderer’s arms like a child who has
been rocked to sleep. Her golden hair falling in profusion about her
shoulders all but concealed the cruel welt of red about her throat. Te
murderer, clutching his precious burden to him, like a mother holding an
infant, appeared dazed. As the police came in, he rose to meet them, still
carrying his precious burden in his arms. The officers almost had to force
him to relinquish her. He could not answer questions –could merely clutch
her closer to his breast all that remained of the girl he loved better than life,
and mutter, “I love her, I love her,” like a man in a dream. A few hours later
when I saw him in the sordid surroundings of the 10th Precinct Station
House, so different from the cozy cottage which had been abode of a tragic
love, he was till dry-eyed, though his face wore a ghastly pallor.
 But when I tried to question him, I became aware of the terrific strain
under which he suffered and he showed all the signs of a man on the verge
of hysteria. When I tried to draw from him the motive of the pitiful tragedy,
he could only reply, his pale boyish face a mask: “I killed her; but God didn’t
say a word, a word.”
 At last he managed pitifully to say, “I killed her so that she would be mine
alone for always!”
 And this is the irony of fate! Separated as they were by wealth, social
position, and all that it implies, it was only in death that they could be united.

                                            F. Make judgement on the values of the characters in the story “The Pardoner’s Tale” and on the values of the people in the Article above. Focus on the most essential values that should have been acceptable before and in modern society. Explain your answer and write it on the space provided. The Pardoner’s Taleby: Geoffrey ChaucerThe Pardoner describes a group of young Flemish people who spend their time drinking and reveling, indulging in all forms of excess. After commenting on their lifestyle of debauchery, the Pardoner enters into a tirade against the vices that they practice. First and foremost is gluttony, which he identifies as the sin that first caused the fall of mankind in Eden. Next, he attacks drunkenness, which makes a man seem mad and witless. Next is gambling, the temptation that ruins men of power and wealth. Finally, he denounces swearing. He argues that it so offends God that he forbade swearing in the Second Commandment—placing it higher up on the list than homicide. After almost two hundred lines of sermonizing, the Pardoner finally returns to his story of the lecherous Flemish youngsters.As three of these rioters sit drinking, they hear a funeral knell. One of the reveler’s servants tells the group that an old friend of theirs was slain that very night by a mysterious figure named Death. The rioters are outraged and, in their drunkenness, decide to find and kill Death to avenge their friend. Traveling down the road, they meet an old man who appears sorrowful. He says his sorrow stems from old age—he has been waiting for Death to come and take him for some time, and he has wandered all over the world. The youths, hearing the name of Death, demand to know where they can find him. The old man directs them into a grove, where he says he just left Death under an oak tree. The rioters rush to the tree, underneath which they find not Death but eight bushels of gold coins with no owner in sight.At first, they are speechless, but, then, the youngest of the three reminds them that if they carry the gold into town in daylight, they will be taken for thieves. They must transport the gold under cover of night, and so someone must run into town to fetch bread and wine in the meantime. They draw lots, and the youngest of the three loses and runs off toward town. As soon as he is gone, the sly plotter turns to his friend and divulges his plan: when their friend returns from town, they will kill him and therefore receive greater shares of the wealth. The second rioter agrees, and they prepare their trap. Back in town, the youngest vagrant is having similar thoughts. He could easily be the richest man in town, he realizes, if he could have all the gold to himself. He goes to the apothecary and buys the strongest poison available, then puts the poison into two bottles of wine, leaving a third bottle pure for himself. He returns to the tree, but the other two rioters leap out and kill him.They sit down to drink their friend’s wine and celebrate, but each happens to pick up a poisoned bottle. Within minutes, they lie dead next to their friend. Thus, concludes the Pardoner, all must beware the sin of avarice, which can only bring treachery and death. He realizes that he has forgotten something: he has relics and pardons in his bag. According to his custom, he tells the pilgrims the value of his relics and asks for contributions—even though he has just told them the relics are fake. He offers the Host the first chance to come forth and kiss the relics, since the Host is clearly the most enveloped in sin. The Host is outraged and proposes to make a relic out of the Pardoner’s genitals, but the Knight calms everybody down. The Host and Pardoner kiss and make up, and all have a good laugh as they continue on their way.please don't answer if you don't really know the answer.​</a>

Use the format listed.The Fall of ManBy: Lumiere, 7/5/20I.History foretells a man stood forth.The edifice foundation ‘til it reaches its growth.Amidst chaos and frailty,He bears a silver suit.Amidst death throes with clouds hazy,He rides valiantly in a silver chariot.II.A man wears a vizer.Colonies would never unravel.Deep within his vest and a blazer,Hidden cuts and scars from fiery battles.Masked with courage and strength.The god of war favors his faith.III.Time has come and love was born.He met a muse as Adam falls.When kingdoms succeed and hatred was torn,Eyes as embers glow like fire and hearts hardened enthralled.Love brings together,A heart of a mellow and a soul of a warrior.IV.Flowers grew from little twigs.The smell of fresh breeze and primrose sweet.A child was born, where miracles meet.A mother’s love like a tree bearing figs.A father’s warmth held in thousand cowslips.Towered into the smile of a child’s lips.V.Decades passed and autumn reigned.The child’s legacy carried upon his veins.For he who hath shed blood,Cast shadows before death.And he who hath taken the dowry of manhood,Bestowed unto him a banquet of tranquility, His power rebirth.VI.For a moment ceases in the life of a silversmith.The tales of baronies and princes to bequeath.A test to take that try man’s will.The angels of heaven, celestial eyes fill.Whilst Hades and his underground pawn,Summon thousands of demons from his lawn.VII.‘Til crows turn white and the Glorious Sol melts the ice.Not even a tear has cometh from his eyes.‘Til that day as winter falls.Clamor caged in empty  halls.The man went out bursting with fear.The dreaded fate of a King Lear.VIII. A kingdom fell in the hands of a traitor.The royal man wept in horror.‘Twas the day that he knew that loyalty and love rust.That legends never tell the weakness of a man’s crust.‘Twas the moment that he stumbled.That Death lays his cradle.IX.Today as time kept away,The promised future resembles a hay.Dried and stored for desperate souls,Fed into the mouths of those who mourn.A feeble hope for broken walls.Man lost his faith, dreams drifted away- the credo of his fall.

unquestioning as a baby, lay in the murderer’s arms like a child who has
been rocked to sleep. Her golden hair falling in profusion about her
shoulders all but concealed the cruel welt of red about her throat. Te
murderer, clutching his precious burden to him, like a mother holding an
infant, appeared dazed. As the police came in, he rose to meet them, still

him to relinquish her. He could not answer questions –could merely clutch
her closer to his breast all that remained of the girl he loved better than life,
and mutter, “I love her, I love her,” like a man in a dream. A few hours later
when I saw him in the sordid surroundings of the 10th Precinct Station
House, so different from the cozy cottage which had been abode of a tragic
love, he was till dry-eyed, though his face wore a ghastly pallor.
 But when I tried to question him, I became aware of the terrific strain
under which he suffered and he showed all the signs of a man on the verge

he could only reply, his pale boyish face a mask: “I killed her; but God didn’t

 And this is the irony of fate! Separated as they were by wealth, social

<p>
</p><strong>A man falls to his death is not really known to Me, yet it will be a hard time to think about how a man dies or enters  his death. A man will actually experience birth, old age , sickness, and death.</strong> It will be a short or long time for a man to enter DEATH!  No man will know exactly the time of his death, for death was like a thief in  the night; one must take care of his own life, not be stolen by the angel of death!  There is no excuse, but prayer really works for an extra  Life to / for Live Longer than Stolen Life / Death!

                        <p>A Man Falls to His Death exemplifies how media, science, mass communication and language illustrates and explains life (and death for that matter). Despite the different factors that surrounded the characters' death (suicide), the form that the persona used was impersonal and detached. Reality, having various dimensions as interpreted by different academic and social constructs, has clouded an emotional understanding of a man's decision to end his life. 
</p><p>
</p><p>If you would notice: the use of geometric formulas to illustrate the fall, including Berger's formula for optics to scientifically explain the impact, demagnifies the man's motivation as parenthesized in the text. 
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is a sad fact, that whenever we hear news on things such as these, the technicality that was called for overpowers the need to remember and respect the life that was.

                        A Man Falls to His Death exemplifies how media, science, mass communication and language illustrates and explains life (and death for that matter). Despite the different factors that surrounded the characters' death (suicide), the form that the persona used was impersonal and detached. Reality, having various dimensions as interpreted by different academic and social constructs, has clouded an emotional understanding of a man's decision to end his life.<br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>C. A typhoon leaving a great damage of properties</p><p>Bec. it leaves a great damage and it will take time to be fix.And a disaster is an event that will cause great damage</p><p>The answer is letter: <strong>C. a typhoon leaving a great damage of properties.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>Because when we say <strong>disaster, </strong>it refers to the unanticipated event, like accidents. It can be also a natural catastrophe. When we say natural catastrophe, it is an event which the nature causes it to happen.</p><p></p><p>Letter A can be the answer, but there is no stated casualties happened. Letter B shows can be, too. But, if you will read the option there, you would see that there are no also affected by this one. Letter D is not a disaster, as it not due by the natural event or a natural catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, letter <strong>C</strong> is the correct answer, as it shows the <strong>disaster </strong>or the <strong>natural catastrophe</strong> and its effect to the community.</p><br />

                            26. F. Make judgement on the values of the characters in the story “The Pardoner’s Tale” and on the values of the people in the Article above. Focus on the most essential values that should have been acceptable before and in modern society. Explain your answer and write it on the space provided. The Pardoner’s Taleby: Geoffrey ChaucerThe Pardoner describes a group of young Flemish people who spend their time drinking and reveling, indulging in all forms of excess. After commenting on their lifestyle of debauchery, the Pardoner enters into a tirade against the vices that they practice. First and foremost is gluttony, which he identifies as the sin that first caused the fall of mankind in Eden. Next, he attacks drunkenness, which makes a man seem mad and witless. Next is gambling, the temptation that ruins men of power and wealth. Finally, he denounces swearing. He argues that it so offends God that he forbade swearing in the Second Commandment—placing it higher up on the list than homicide. After almost two hundred lines of sermonizing, the Pardoner finally returns to his story of the lecherous Flemish youngsters.As three of these rioters sit drinking, they hear a funeral knell. One of the reveler’s servants tells the group that an old friend of theirs was slain that very night by a mysterious figure named Death. The rioters are outraged and, in their drunkenness, decide to find and kill Death to avenge their friend. Traveling down the road, they meet an old man who appears sorrowful. He says his sorrow stems from old age—he has been waiting for Death to come and take him for some time, and he has wandered all over the world. The youths, hearing the name of Death, demand to know where they can find him. The old man directs them into a grove, where he says he just left Death under an oak tree. The rioters rush to the tree, underneath which they find not Death but eight bushels of gold coins with no owner in sight.At first, they are speechless, but, then, the youngest of the three reminds them that if they carry the gold into town in daylight, they will be taken for thieves. They must transport the gold under cover of night, and so someone must run into town to fetch bread and wine in the meantime. They draw lots, and the youngest of the three loses and runs off toward town. As soon as he is gone, the sly plotter turns to his friend and divulges his plan: when their friend returns from town, they will kill him and therefore receive greater shares of the wealth. The second rioter agrees, and they prepare their trap. Back in town, the youngest vagrant is having similar thoughts. He could easily be the richest man in town, he realizes, if he could have all the gold to himself. He goes to the apothecary and buys the strongest poison available, then puts the poison into two bottles of wine, leaving a third bottle pure for himself. He returns to the tree, but the other two rioters leap out and kill him.They sit down to drink their friend’s wine and celebrate, but each happens to pick up a poisoned bottle. Within minutes, they lie dead next to their friend. Thus, concludes the Pardoner, all must beware the sin of avarice, which can only bring treachery and death. He realizes that he has forgotten something: he has relics and pardons in his bag. According to his custom, he tells the pilgrims the value of his relics and asks for contributions—even though he has just told them the relics are fake. He offers the Host the first chance to come forth and kiss the relics, since the Host is clearly the most enveloped in sin. The Host is outraged and proposes to make a relic out of the Pardoner’s genitals, but the Knight calms everybody down. The Host and Pardoner kiss and make up, and all have a good laugh as they continue on their way.please don't answer if you don't really know the answer.​</h2><br />

Use the format listed.The Fall of ManBy: Lumiere, 7/5/20I.History foretells a man stood forth.The edifice foundation ‘til it reaches its growth.Amidst chaos and frailty,He bears a silver suit.Amidst death throes with clouds hazy,He rides valiantly in a silver chariot.II.A man wears a vizer.Colonies would never unravel.Deep within his vest and a blazer,Hidden cuts and scars from fiery battles.Masked with courage and strength.The god of war favors his faith.III.Time has come and love was born.He met a muse as Adam falls.When kingdoms succeed and hatred was torn,Eyes as embers glow like fire and hearts hardened enthralled.Love brings together,A heart of a mellow and a soul of a warrior.IV.Flowers grew from little twigs.The smell of fresh breeze and primrose sweet.A child was born, where miracles meet.A mother’s love like a tree bearing figs.A father’s warmth held in thousand cowslips.Towered into the smile of a child’s lips.V.Decades passed and autumn reigned.The child’s legacy carried upon his veins.For he who hath shed blood,Cast shadows before death.And he who hath taken the dowry of manhood,Bestowed unto him a banquet of tranquility, His power rebirth.VI.For a moment ceases in the life of a silversmith.The tales of baronies and princes to bequeath.A test to take that try man’s will.The angels of heaven, celestial eyes fill.Whilst Hades and his underground pawn,Summon thousands of demons from his lawn.VII.‘Til crows turn white and the Glorious Sol melts the ice.Not even a tear has cometh from his eyes.‘Til that day as winter falls.Clamor caged in empty  halls.The man went out bursting with fear.The dreaded fate of a King Lear.VIII. A kingdom fell in the hands of a traitor.The royal man wept in horror.‘Twas the day that he knew that loyalty and love rust.That legends never tell the weakness of a man’s crust.‘Twas the moment that he stumbled.That Death lays his cradle.IX.Today as time kept away,The promised future resembles a hay.Dried and stored for desperate souls,Fed into the mouths of those who mourn.A feeble hope for broken walls.Man lost his faith, dreams drifted away- the credo of his fall.
