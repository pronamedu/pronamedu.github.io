At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending. But now, I cansee how forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably brings​</a>

                                            Why English is Hard to Learn We'll begin with a box: the plural is boxes, But the plural of ox is oxen, not oxes. One fowl is goose, and two are called geese, Yet the plural of moose is never called meese. You may find a lone mouse or a house full of mice; But the plural of house is houses, not hice. The plural of man is always men, But the plural of pan is never pen. If I speak of a foot, and you show me two feet, And I give you a book, would a pair be a beek? If one is a tooth and the whole set are teeth, Why shouldn't two booths be called beeth? If the singular's this and the plural is these, Should the plural of kiss be called keese? We speak of a brother and also of brethren, But though we say mother, we never say methren. Then masculine pronouns are he, his, and him; But imagine the feminine...she, shis, and shim! aIT IS A ANONYMOUS OR IT IS A ANONYMOUSES??? ​</a>

Directions: Read and critique the reflective essay and use the rubric below.My Little BrotherIn my short life, there are many experiences that could qualify as life-changing. Every newexperience was, at one time or another, the first experience. For good or bad, each instancechanged the course that my life has taken. But, the most transformative experience was the birthof my youngest brother.Joel is someone my parents often call a happy accident. At the time that my mother becamepregnant, I was 13, and my other brother, Jake, was 10. We were what you would call a well-rounded, perfect family of four. We neatly fit into the perfect classification in nearly every way.We didn't realize what we were missing until the moment that my youngest brother first openedhis striking blue eyes.In truth, I resented the fact that I would be having another sibling. Nothing needed to be addedto our family, and my mother, already 38 at the time, was considered high risk because of herage. The pregnancy itself was full of complications that sent the straight course of my life intorollercoaster-like loops that my 13-year-old mind had a hard time comprehending. But now, I cansee how forging through those loops helped me to roll with the punches that life inevitably brings​</h2><br />

                            17. Why English is Hard to Learn We'll begin with a box: the plural is boxes, But the plural of ox is oxen, not oxes. One fowl is goose, and two are called geese, Yet the plural of moose is never called meese. You may find a lone mouse or a house full of mice; But the plural of house is houses, not hice. The plural of man is always men, But the plural of pan is never pen. If I speak of a foot, and you show me two feet, And I give you a book, would a pair be a beek? If one is a tooth and the whole set are teeth, Why shouldn't two booths be called beeth? If the singular's this and the plural is these, Should the plural of kiss be called keese? We speak of a brother and also of brethren, But though we say mother, we never say methren. Then masculine pronouns are he, his, and him; But imagine the feminine...she, shis, and shim! aIT IS A ANONYMOUS OR IT IS A ANONYMOUSES??? ​</h2><br />
