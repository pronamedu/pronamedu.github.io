Serenade
(Harana)
O lamp in the cold night,
You’re as a star in the sky;
O light in the quite night,
Your image, Dear, bringing me pain; ay!
Arise and stir from where you lie
For slumber deep
Open your window and look down at me
That you may know my true pleadings.
Did you think I’m forgetting,
I remember you at night, sleeping;
Flowing tears for my mat,
Sorrow for my pillows.
Hoe pitiless you have been, how merciless!
Mired is the earth with my tears.
Open then, Dear, your little window
And look down at me pleading.

Serenade
(Harana)
O lamp in the cold night,
You’re as a star in the sky;
O light in the quite night,
Your image, Dear, bringing me pain; ay!
Arise and stir from where you lie
For slumber deep
Open your window and look down at me
That you may know my true pleadings.
Did you think I’m forgetting,
I remember you at night, sleeping;
Flowing tears for my mat,
Sorrow for my pillows.
Hoe pitiless you have been, how merciless!
Mired is the earth with my tears.
Open then, Dear, your little window
And look down at me pleading.

When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in anumber of ways. Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity.
