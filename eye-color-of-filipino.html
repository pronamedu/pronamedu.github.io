Filipino resilience: Family, Faith, and Fun (An Excerpt)
By Henry Manucia
Manila, Philippines- When Supper Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit Tacloban City on Nov. 8, 2013, the storm surge swept away the parents of seven-year-old boy. The tragedy did not just sweep his parents away from him, it took his voice as well.
We saw him four weeks later playing with a broken bike at the MacArthur Shrine. All that remained was the frail
body of seven-year-old boy whose faded eyes tried to hide a story so huge and too heavy to draw out. I greeted him and took his quick glance as a door that opened slightly to allow me into an incredible story of tragedy, survival, and anger.
The encounter with this young boy is by no means uncommon. Yet each story had always been unique in those
instances that we had purposely responded to human disasters and natural calamities in these past 1 years. In a calibrated response of rescue, relief and retrieval when calamities and disaster strikes, we would mobilize to
join the other teams in the field from 30 to 45 days after they hit the ground. What we had experienced in the field had taught us that the survivors are not the only ones affected by the
extraordinary experience. The tragedy of loss drains the survivors of their emotional capital. The gaping vacuum of human vitality and the unending stream of needs create a growing helplessness among the first responders. This easily replaces the energy that is sapped from them day after day. Apart from the survivors therefore, the responders are likewise affected in the aftermath of disasters and calamities.
This is the natural narrative of a people who are in the path of typhoons, whose land sits on an earthquake belt, and
whose cultural history is spiced by intrusions and invasion. Yet those who get a glimpse of this collage of colors on the
Philippine palette would gush in amazement at how resilient the Filipinos are.</a>

Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;

In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

                                            As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.

                                            As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.Comprehension Check: What do you suppose happened right after?

                                            Text Selection 1 The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil 82 no one could do Bailey bridge, as insolent than the jeepney, If one were looking for a symbol of postwar Philippines, c y, which is as abundant and as persistent as postwar mosquitoes, as noisy and dangerous as postwar politics, as useful as a b as a squatter, and as much a creature of improvisation as the postwar Filipino. de a shop on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance.

                                            The paragraphs below consist of shuffled parts of a movie review. Arrange the paragraphs to form a comprehensive movie review of the film, “Kita-Kita”. Organize the paragraphs using the letters of the alphabet. Start with the letter A to arrange the paragraphs in sequential order. ____________1. It’s so simple an idea but it works. “Kita Kita” is really just a two-actor film about a Filipino tour guide in Saporro, Japan, who gets her heart broken and goes blind. Her neighbor, also a Filipino, comes over to her house every day to try and cheer her up and a romance blossoms between them. The movie revolves around this simple plot yet it fills out its 84-minute running time and leaves you completely satisfied at the end. There’s this push and pull about the gimmick of her being blind but it’s used more narratively, and even lyrically, than it is for easy jokes. ____________2. ‘Kita Kita’ is an eye-opener for the romantic comedy genre ____________3. And writer/director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo knows what to do with her camera. In a film about not being able to see, she knows when to give us close-ups and knows when to zoom out. She frames the couple amidst a backdrop of a quaint and rural Japan with the knowledge that one of these characters cannot see it. But in the breaking down of Lea’s walls, the grand architecture or the fields of multi-colored flowers become symbols of Lea’s internal world. It’s a lovely use of cinematography for a film like this. ____________4. It seems, in its trailers, that the comedy is going to stem from Empoy Marquez being not the typical matinee idol and romantic lead type for a woman as gorgeous as Alessandra de Rossi except, since she’s blind, she doesn’t know that. But the film never goes there. It doesn’t go for the easy laughs. Her blindness is caused by the stress of her breakup, and she is shut out from life, and Marquez’s Tonyo asks her to be his tour guide as he will be her eyes. What unfolds is a story about kindness and how it can warm even the coldest of hearts. The film utiliz</a>

Filipino resilience: Family, Faith, and Fun (An Excerpt)
By Henry Manucia
Manila, Philippines- When Supper Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit Tacloban City on Nov. 8, 2013, the storm surge swept away the parents of seven-year-old boy. The tragedy did not just sweep his parents away from him, it took his voice as well.
We saw him four weeks later playing with a broken bike at the MacArthur Shrine. All that remained was the frail
body of seven-year-old boy whose faded eyes tried to hide a story so huge and too heavy to draw out. I greeted him and took his quick glance as a door that opened slightly to allow me into an incredible story of tragedy, survival, and anger.
The encounter with this young boy is by no means uncommon. Yet each story had always been unique in those
instances that we had purposely responded to human disasters and natural calamities in these past 1 years. In a calibrated response of rescue, relief and retrieval when calamities and disaster strikes, we would mobilize to
join the other teams in the field from 30 to 45 days after they hit the ground. What we had experienced in the field had taught us that the survivors are not the only ones affected by the
extraordinary experience. The tragedy of loss drains the survivors of their emotional capital. The gaping vacuum of human vitality and the unending stream of needs create a growing helplessness among the first responders. This easily replaces the energy that is sapped from them day after day. Apart from the survivors therefore, the responders are likewise affected in the aftermath of disasters and calamities.
This is the natural narrative of a people who are in the path of typhoons, whose land sits on an earthquake belt, and
whose cultural history is spiced by intrusions and invasion. Yet those who get a glimpse of this collage of colors on the
Philippine palette would gush in amazement at how resilient the Filipinos are.</h2><br />

Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;

In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

                            17. As the dismaying predicament seemed beyond solution, Rizal’s nimble brain conceived a cute solution. Appearing perfectly at ease, he turned to the waiter and said, “My dear fellow,” he spoke in French, “don’t you worry.” Pointing to Luna with a flourish of his hand, he said, “Monsieur is quite right. I am the host of this party and I will take care of everything. But first, let my guests complete their meal. We must have black coffee and the best brandy the house can offer. I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.

I want the coffee to be freshly brewed. Tell the chef to boil it slowly and nicely. I’ll give him a handsome tip – and to be sure, you will receive a bigger one. The waiter relieved at the turn of the situation had taken and heartened by the promise of the big tip, went to the restaurant’s kitchen to supervise personally the making of the coffee. The brown gentlemen spoke such excellent French, he surely must be a rich potentiate or Maharajah from the Far East. There was really nothing to fear about the bill, so he mused. Back at the table, the Filipinos were demanding an explanation. Rizal was silent, his brown eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement. “Now, you’re making it worse,” upbraided the hot-tempered Luna. “You know we all have no money and still you ordered coffee and brandy to say nothing of the big tips you promised the cook and the waiter. Why do you want to disgrace us all? Are you a fool?” “No,” was Rizal’s laconic answer. To the great amazement of Luna and the others, Rizal took out from his coat pocket a portable water color set, and serenely began to paint a 10-pound sterling note on the porcelain platter. Dexterously, with a few master strokes he finished an astounding replica of the note before the arrival of the steaming coffee and the brandy. “My good fellow,” Rizal told the smiling waiter. Pointing to the platter: “There’s the payment for all we have taken. You may keep the change.” The waiter’s eyes lit up. Bowing low in the best tradition of a French waiter acknowledging an unusually good tip, the waiter was full of effusive thanks. “Monsieur is most generous, Merci!” reaching for the platter he bowed out with many sonorous kiss of his fingertips. Calmly, Rizal started to sip his coffee and brandy while enjoying the amazement on the faces of his compatriots who all held their breaths while waiting for what inevitably would happen next.Comprehension Check: What do you suppose happened right after?

                            24.

It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion imaginative estimat the C C.1. Who is Carmen Guerrero Nakpil?2. How did the author describe jeepney?3. What does the jeepney symbolized?4. Is the creation of jeepney beneficial to Filipinos?5. Are you amenable to the proposed phase out of jeepney?​</h2><br />
                        1. Carmen Guerrero Nakpil is the author of the text "The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity."<br /><br />2. The author described the jeepney as a flamboyant, abundantly decorated vehicle that is noisy, crowded, and dangerous. It can carry six to ten passengers, and sometimes up to twelve, and is a creature of improvisation and ingenuity.<br /><br />3. The jeepney symbolizes postwar Philippines, with its abundance, persistence, usefulness, and improvisation. It is a product of Filipino ingenuity and resourcefulness, and a reflection of the country's history and culture.<br /><br />4. The text does not provide a direct answer to this question, but it does highlight the jeepney's usefulness, creativity, and cultural significance.<br /><br />5. As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, the proposed phase-out of jeepneys is a controversial issue that has sparked debates and protests in the Philippines. Supporters argue that it is necessary to modernize the public transportation system and reduce air pollution, while critics argue that it will displace thousands of drivers and harm small businesses.<br />

                            27. The paragraphs below consist of shuffled parts of a movie review. Arrange the paragraphs to form a comprehensive movie review of the film, “Kita-Kita”. Organize the paragraphs using the letters of the alphabet. Start with the letter A to arrange the paragraphs in sequential order. ____________1. It’s so simple an idea but it works. “Kita Kita” is really just a two-actor film about a Filipino tour guide in Saporro, Japan, who gets her heart broken and goes blind. Her neighbor, also a Filipino, comes over to her house every day to try and cheer her up and a romance blossoms between them. The movie revolves around this simple plot yet it fills out its 84-minute running time and leaves you completely satisfied at the end. There’s this push and pull about the gimmick of her being blind but it’s used more narratively, and even lyrically, than it is for easy jokes. ____________2. ‘Kita Kita’ is an eye-opener for the romantic comedy genre ____________3. And writer/director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo knows what to do with her camera. In a film about not being able to see, she knows when to give us close-ups and knows when to zoom out. She frames the couple amidst a backdrop of a quaint and rural Japan with the knowledge that one of these characters cannot see it. But in the breaking down of Lea’s walls, the grand architecture or the fields of multi-colored flowers become symbols of Lea’s internal world. It’s a lovely use of cinematography for a film like this. ____________4. It seems, in its trailers, that the comedy is going to stem from Empoy Marquez being not the typical matinee idol and romantic lead type for a woman as gorgeous as Alessandra de Rossi except, since she’s blind, she doesn’t know that. But the film never goes there. It doesn’t go for the easy laughs. Her blindness is caused by the stress of her breakup, and she is shut out from life, and Marquez’s Tonyo asks her to be his tour guide as he will be her eyes. What unfolds is a story about kindness and how it can warm even the coldest of hearts. The film utiliz</h2><br />
