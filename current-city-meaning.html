                    <p>In rural areas where electric power lines carry current to big cities, it is possible to generate small amounts of electricity from the lines by means of induction single coil. The overhead power lines carry relatively large currents that periodically reverse in direction 60 times per second. How would you ORIENT the plane of the coil to produced maximum induced current if the power lines ran in a north-to-south direction? 
 a. Parallel to the ground 
 b. Perpendicular to the ground in the North to South direction 
 c. Perpendicular to the ground in the East to West direction 
 d. That the orientation of the coil would not affect the size of the current induced. </p>

Last year, the number of tourist arrivalsfor these four months (March to June), as per submitted hotel check-in data, was 517.107. Andconsidering a survey that says each tourist spends P2,700 per visit, per person, we can estimate thatP1.4 billion of potential gross tourist receipts did not come in this year. That amount could have beenwhat went to the salaries of employees and income of tourism businesses and their suppliers, spreadacross different sectors including the events, entertainment, and creative sectors.In a life-changing moment, the city that thrived and prospered as a popular tourist destinationis suddenly struggling. No tourists mean no business, no income, no livelihood. From accommodationestablishments alone, around 4,000 employees are affected and fearing possible retrenchment VictoryLiner, a tourism partner of North Luzon destinations, has already laid off 400 employees. In BurnhamPark, there are around 250 concessioners, aides, vendors, guides and photographers, who currentlyhave no source of income. According to DOT-CAR OIC Jovi Ganongan. 12 ESL (English as SecondLanguage) schools, now recognized as a growing tourism sector with foreign students as their market,had displaced 1,048 teachers and employees.The Baguio Tourism Council is conducting a survey that will assess the impact of thispandemic to tourism-oriented establishments. And so far, 33 businesses are saying that they will haveno other option but to shut down operations. One of our favorite home-grown restaurants, ForestHouse Bistro and Café, which closed recently, may just be the tip of the iceberg.Yes, the struggle is real. Employment, livelihood, and business revenue are at an all-time low.And the effect will trickle down to city revenue - no business means no taxes. Even the PhilippineNational Police looked at it from a different perspective, unemployment could mean more crimes.Depressing times indeed.

Mapalo: The struggle is real: Depressing yet hopefulJuly 3, 2020 Sunstar Daily BaguioIt's been almost four months now since the government announced a national quarantineThese are supposed to be Baguio's peak season for tourists. Last year, the number of tourist arrivalsfor these four months (March to June), as per submitted hotel check-in data, was 517.107. Andconsidering a survey that says each tourist spends P2,700 per visit, per person, we can estimate thatP1.4 billion of potential gross tourist receipts did not come in this year. That amount could have beenwhat went to the salaries of employees and income of tourism businesses and their suppliers, spreadacross different sectors including the events, entertainment, and creative sectors.In a life-changing moment, the city that thrived and prospered as a popular tourist destinationis suddenly struggling. No tourists mean no business, no income, no livelihood. From accommodationestablishments alone, around 4,000 employees are affected and fearing possible retrenchment VictoryLiner, a tourism partner of North Luzon destinations, has already laid off 400 employees. In BurnhamPark, there are around 250 concessioners, aides, vendors, guides and photographers, who currentlyhave no source of income. According to DOT-CAR OIC Jovi Ganongan. 12 ESL (English as SecondLanguage) schools, now recognized as a growing tourism sector with foreign students as their market,had displaced 1,048 teachers and employees.The Baguio Tourism Council is conducting a survey that will assess the impact of thispandemic to tourism-oriented establishments. And so far, 33 businesses are saying that they will haveno other option but to shut down operations. One of our favorite home-grown restaurants, ForestHouse Bistro and Café, which closed recently, may just be the tip of the iceberg.Yes, the struggle is real. Employment, livelihood, and business revenue are at an all-time low.And the effect will trickle down to city revenue - no business means no taxes. Even the PhilippineNational Police looked at it from a different perspective, unemployment could mean more crimes.Depressing times indeed.

Pa help po ano pong pwede o magandang conclusion dito?Intro.Meaning. - Disaster preparedness plays a critical role in mitigating the adverse health effects of natural disaster. Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay. As the capital city of the Bulacan, the city of Malolos is comprised of 51 barangays, including five coastal islands. Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September.
