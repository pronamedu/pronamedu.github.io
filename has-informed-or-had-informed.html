I drop by the office because I had left my mobile phone inside the drawer of my workstation. But was surprised to see that Ms. Joy Palasuroy and Mr. Robert Palainum had seemingly been comfortably in a state of very deep slumber. For your immediate attention and action." 
It is the policy of the company to withhold the information of the informant. And currently, no one in the HR department has the access to verify the sender as it needs to make a formal request to the IT department first. However, records indicated that Ms. Palasuroy and Mr. Palainum indeed came in at 3 am on 15 March.
Ashamed of the incident, Joy had not since been reporting for work while Robert admitted the allegation during the initial interrogation though insisted to reveal the identity of the informant.
