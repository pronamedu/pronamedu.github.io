1.All good researches’ data are based on evidence, never hearsays. *
2.Scope and delimitation of the study are the two important elements in research that informs the readers what information should be included and why it should be included in the study. *
3.Limitations do not have weakness and it will not influence the end results of the study. *
4.Limitations are constraints that are largely beyond the control of the researcher but could affect the study outcome. *
5.A hypothesis should NOT be directly related to the research problem. *
6.Research question are set of questions that needs to be answered. *
7.A hypothesis should be stated in such a form that it can be accepted or rejected. *
8.The null hypothesis is what we attempt to find evidence against in our hypothesis test. *
9.Information about participants can weaken the study’s background. *
10.A well-crafted background will result in 100% accurate data. *
11.Research only makes use of available FRESH data. Originality holds NO place in research. *
12.Good researchers should aim for perfect research, with no limitations *
13.A lousy review of literature may damage the study’s background. *
14.SHS students are too young to be researchers. *
15.Research question can be copied from other researches. *
15.Originality holds NO place in research. *
16.The Corona Virus problem can be solved by research. *

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>My research study is about the development and evaluation of a new educational technology platform for online learning.I chose this study because of the increasing demand for online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for more effective and engaging platforms to facilitate it.e-RTU is an acronym for "electronic Learning Resource and Training for Teachers and Students of the Rajabhat University." It is an educational technology platform developed for the Rajabhat University in Thailand.I chose this particular title for my research because it accurately reflects the main focus and purpose of the study.The scope of my study includes the design and development of the e-RTU platform, its implementation and evaluation in a real-world online learning environment, and the analysis of its effectiveness and user satisfaction.The phenomenon I am trying to understand with this research is the impact of a new educational technology platform on the online learning experience of teachers and students.Educators, students, and administrators of educational institutions will be most interested in my research.Yes, my research questions evolved during the process as I gained a better understanding of the potential impact and limitations of the e-RTU platform.I intended to bridge the gap between traditional face-to-face learning and online learning by providing a more interactive and engaging platform for remote education.My research is significant and important because it has the potential to improve the quality and accessibility of online learning, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.So far, my research has found that the e-RTU platform has been effective in enhancing the online learning experience of teachers and students, with high levels of satisfaction and engagement reported.My hypothesis was that the e-RTU platform would have a positive impact on the online learning experience of teachers and students, based on its innovative design and features.I chose a mixed-methods approach for my study, including both quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the e-RTU platform's effectiveness and user experience.Yes, I was expecting to find a positive correlation between the use of the e-RTU platform and improved learning outcomes and engagement.I related my study to the existing theories in the literature on online learning, educational technology, and instructional design, to provide a theoretical framework and context for my research.You should care about my research because it has the potential to inform and improve the future of online education, which is becoming increasingly important and prevalent in today's society.<p></p><br />
