Every morning, the bird sang so beautifully that all the animals in the forest felt glad to be alive. One day, the bird far-away sang so loudly and happily that the king in his castle heard the beautiful melody. "I want that bird," shouted the king, who was used to getting his own way. Hunters brought the bird in a cage to the king. "Sing for me," announced the king. The bird refused. “Then I'll eat you for dinner," said the king The cook was afraid but the bird told her not to worry. "Even a king cannot destroy a beautiful idea," the bird saidThe cook gently stroked the bird before putting it into the pot. At dinner, the king ate the bird. The king started to swell up. He got the wickedness of his life poured out to him from all over the land. Then, the people in the kingdom heard a song more beautifully than any they have ever heard before.​</a>

                                            What's that humming sound? Could it be the hummingbird, the only bird capable of backward flight? Hummingbirds have many unique flight habits that distinguish them from other birds. Most birds flap their wings up and down to fly, but the hummingbird moves its wings forward and backward very rapidly in a figure-eight pattern. This allows the hummingbird to hover in position. They can also fly upside down and move about very rapidly. Other birds have to push off with their feet to begin flying and work their ways up to their top speeds. The hummingbird can both start flying at maximum speed and stop flying instantaneously. Once you've seen a hummingbird in flight, it's unlikely that you'll mistake them for another bird.

                            28. What's that humming sound? Could it be the hummingbird, the only bird capable of backward flight? Hummingbirds have many unique flight habits that distinguish them from other birds. Most birds flap their wings up and down to fly, but the hummingbird moves its wings forward and backward very rapidly in a figure-eight pattern. This allows the hummingbird to hover in position. They can also fly upside down and move about very rapidly. Other birds have to push off with their feet to begin flying and work their ways up to their top speeds. The hummingbird can both start flying at maximum speed and stop flying instantaneously. Once you've seen a hummingbird in flight, it's unlikely that you'll mistake them for another bird.
