A kulintang and agung ensemble always accompanies the dance. The female lead dancer plays the role of Princess Gandingan of the Darangen epic, wearing the heavy rings around her ankles to keep time while she dances.</strong><strong>Singkil originated from the Maranao people who inhabit the shores of Lake Lanao. It is a re-telling of an episode from the Maranao epic legend Darangen involving the rescue of Princess Gandingan (abducted by diwata) by the legendary Prince Bantugan.</strong><strong>Singkil (or Sayaw sa Kasingkil) is a famous dance of the Maranao people of Lake Lanao, which was popularized by the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company. ... Singkil means to entangle the feet with disturbing objects such as vines or anything in your path.</strong><strong>(Maranao, Mindanao) Coming from the Lake Lanao region, the Singkil is a popular dance performed during celebrations and other festive entertainment. Performed as a female only dance, the Singkil serves as either a conscious or unconscious advertisement to would-be suitors for her future marriage.</strong><strong>Singkil is a Mindanao folk dance that originated from the Maranao people and is based on the story in the Darangen, the pre-Islamic Maranao interpretation of the ancient Hindu Indian epic, the Ramayana.</strong><strong>The female lead dancer plays the role of Princess Gandingan of the Darangen epic, wearing the heavy rings around her ankles to keep time while she dances. In an episode of the Maranao epic, the princess is caught in the middle of the forest during an earthquake caused by the diwatas (or the guardian spirits) of the Kingdom of Bumbaran.[2] The diwatas abducted the princess and entrapped her into a forest to teach the philandering Prince Bantugan a lesson.[2][3] The falling trees during the earthquake (which the princess gracefully avoids) are represented by the bamboo poles arranged in a criss-crossed fashion and clacked together in a unique, syncopated rhythm. During the performance, the female lead dancer graciously steps in and out of the bamboo poles as she manipulates two elaborately designed fans called apir. Another female dancer represents the loyal slave of the princess who accompanies her throughout the ordeal. After a while, a male dancer, representing the legendary Prince Bantugan of the Darangen epic, performs his dance round and through the bamboo poles clacked together bearing a shield and a sword. The entrance of the male dancer symbolizes the arrival of Prince Bantugan who is determined to rescue the princess from the diwatas. Other dancers skillfully manipulate the apir fans, which represent the winds which prove to be auspicious. The dance steps require agile movement so that the dancer's feet won't be crushed by the moving bamboos. Meanwhile, the clacking </strong><strong>Singkil originated from the Maranao people who inhabit the shores of Lake Lanao.[1] It is a re-telling of an episode from the Maranao epic legend Darangen involving the rescue of Princess Gandingan (abducted by diwata) by the legendary Prince Bantugan.[2] It is a popular dance performed during celebrations and other festive entertainment. Originally only women, particularly royalty, danced the Singkil, which serves as either a conscious or unconscious advertisement to potential suitors. The dance takes its name from the heavy rings worn on the ankles of the Muslim princess.[2] A kulintang and agung ensemble always accompanies the dance.</strong><p></p><p>[tex]Hope it helps[/tex]シ</p><br />
