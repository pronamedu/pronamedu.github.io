                                            III. Read the passage and look for the author’s point of view. Then answer the questions below.
Every Englishman is born with a certain miraculous power that makes him master of the world. When he wants a thing he never tells himself that he wants it. He waits patiently till their comes into his head, no one knows how, a burning conviction that it is his moral and religious duty to conquer those who have got the thing he wants. Then he… conquers half the world and calls it Colonization. When he wants a new market for hi new adultered Manchester goods, he sends a missionary to teach the natives the gospel of peace. The natives kill the missionary; he flies to arm in defense of Christianity; fights for it; and takes the market as a reward from heaven….
You will never find an Englishman in the wrong. He does everything on principle. He fights you on patriotic principles; he robs you on business principles; he enslaves you on imperial principles; he bullies you on manly principles; he supports his king on loyal principles, and cuts off his king’s head on republican principles. His watchword is always duty; and he never forgets that the nation which lets its duty get on the opposite side to its interest is lost.

                                            Southampton Football Club put up a brave fight against Manchester City last night. Although Manchester won, scoring their only goal in the very last minute of the match, Southampton should be proud of the way they played. Manchester City only had two shots on target because Southampton played so well. Southampton had three shots on target, but unfortunately all of them were saved by City’s keeper. Even though Southampton played amazingly and went extra mile to stop City from getting a goal, they suffered the same bad luck they have had all season. In the final minute, the Manchester team managed to score. In the end, it was an entertaining game, so Southampton players and fans can hold their heads high. Is the article biased or not?

                                            In August 2000, a young woman from Gozo, an island south of Italy, discovered that she was carrying conjoined twins. Knowing that health-care facilities on Gozo were inadequate to deal with the complications of such a birth, she and her husband went to St. Mary’s Hospital in Manchester, England, to have the babies delivered. The infants, known as Mary and Jodie, were joined at the lower abdomen. Their spines were fused, and they had one heart and one pair of lungs between them. Jodie, the stronger one, was providing blood for her sister.No one knows how many sets of conjoined twins are born each year, but the number has been estimated at 200. Most die shortly after birth, but some conjoined twins do well. They grow to adulthood and marry and have children themselves. But the outlook for Mary and Jodie was grim. The doctors said that without intervention the girls would die within six months. The only hope was an operation to separate them. This would save Jodie, but Mary would die immediately.The parents, who were devout Catholics, refused permission for the operation on the grounds that it would hasten Mary’s death. “We believe that nature should take its course,” they said. “ if it is God’s will that both our children should not survive, then so be it.” The hospital, hoping to save at least of the infant, petitioned the courts for permission to separate them over the parent’s objections.  The court granted permission, and the operation was performed.  As expected, Jodie lived  and Mary died.Questions:1. Who should make the decision from the question of what the decision should be?2. Would it be right or wrong, in these circumstances,, to separate the twins?​</a>

                            4. III. Read the passage and look for the author’s point of view. Then answer the questions below.
Every Englishman is born with a certain miraculous power that makes him master of the world. When he wants a thing he never tells himself that he wants it. He waits patiently till their comes into his head, no one knows how, a burning conviction that it is his moral and religious duty to conquer those who have got the thing he wants. Then he… conquers half the world and calls it Colonization. When he wants a new market for hi new adultered Manchester goods, he sends a missionary to teach the natives the gospel of peace. The natives kill the missionary; he flies to arm in defense of Christianity; fights for it; and takes the market as a reward from heaven….
You will never find an Englishman in the wrong. He does everything on principle. He fights you on patriotic principles; he robs you on business principles; he enslaves you on imperial principles; he bullies you on manly principles; he supports his king on loyal principles, and cuts off his king’s head on republican principles. His watchword is always duty; and he never forgets that the nation which lets its duty get on the opposite side to its interest is lost.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Read argument with critical eye. Lookout for assumptions, in how writer moves from evidence to conclusion. Analyze the chain of reasoning used. All essays will be flawed. Explain how a different approach or more information would make the argument better or worse. Analyze the logical soundness of argument conclusion/evidence, not really agreeing or disagreeing. Evaluate someone else's argument by assessing their claims and evaluate evidence provided.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>copy lang po iyan hehe no. 1 lang po sorry sa iba Kung wala</p><br />

                            18. Southampton Football Club put up a brave fight against Manchester City last night. Although Manchester won, scoring their only goal in the very last minute of the match, Southampton should be proud of the way they played. Manchester City only had two shots on target because Southampton played so well. Southampton had three shots on target, but unfortunately all of them were saved by City’s keeper. Even though Southampton played amazingly and went extra mile to stop City from getting a goal, they suffered the same bad luck they have had all season. In the final minute, the Manchester team managed to score. In the end, it was an entertaining game, so Southampton players and fans can hold their heads high. Is the article biased or not? Why do you think so?​</h2><br />

                            19. In August 2000, a young woman from Gozo, an island south of Italy, discovered that she was carrying conjoined twins. Knowing that health-care facilities on Gozo were inadequate to deal with the complications of such a birth, she and her husband went to St. Mary’s Hospital in Manchester, England, to have the babies delivered. The infants, known as Mary and Jodie, were joined at the lower abdomen. Their spines were fused, and they had one heart and one pair of lungs between them. Jodie, the stronger one, was providing blood for her sister.No one knows how many sets of conjoined twins are born each year, but the number has been estimated at 200. Most die shortly after birth, but some conjoined twins do well. They grow to adulthood and marry and have children themselves. But the outlook for Mary and Jodie was grim. The doctors said that without intervention the girls would die within six months. The only hope was an operation to separate them. This would save Jodie, but Mary would die immediately.The parents, who were devout Catholics, refused permission for the operation on the grounds that it would hasten Mary’s death. “We believe that nature should take its course,” they said. “ if it is God’s will that both our children should not survive, then so be it.” The hospital, hoping to save at least of the infant, petitioned the courts for permission to separate them over the parent’s objections.  The court granted permission, and the operation was performed.  As expected, Jodie lived  and Mary died.Questions:1. Who should make the decision from the question of what the decision should be?2. Would it be right or wrong, in these circumstances,, to separate the twins?​</h2><br />
