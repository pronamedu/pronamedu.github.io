It has over 8,000 direct-hired employees who stayed for an average of 12 years in the company due to better staffing approach and retention programs. Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. in Pampanga market, which included 12 different stores, required instantaneous provisional workers to convene their staffing demands due to natural hazards and risks such as typhoon and earthquakes that happened in Pampanga in the summer of 2019. Previously, the company had never outsourced a temporary recruitment agency domestically for their staffing motives, however due to the exigency, the company executives decided to tie up with human resource staffing agencies. High number of competent workers needed is the main reason of the decision of company to come up in partnering with staffing firms to acquire the lack of workforce they had locally in their Human Resource department. The competency, educational attainment, and job experience of the needed employees were an extensive range which requires various recruitment personnel to handle each. The following job vacancies include purchasing, sales, warehouse managers, general labours and clerical employees. Time frame of two weeks was set up to deliver a total of 175 employees in the first month. Questions: 1. Describe the main challenge/s of Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc.?​</a>

Your previous job was at a large office supplies company, Paperclips123, where you worked in the finance department and were involved in developing strategy and producing the annual report. Hypothetical Marketing has a contract with Paperclips123 to supply all office supplies, and the contract is up for renewal. The head of procurement, Sofia, asks you for a meeting to discuss the contract renewal. This isn’t out of the ordinary — you know that part of your new role is to discuss any important contract renewals with Sofia to ensure you’re on the same page on budget and key contract clauses. In the meeting, Sofia asks you for your take on Paperclips123’s current financial performance and strategy. She thinks that the company might be willing to compromise on price in return for better payment terms — there has been a rumour that Paperclips123 has cash flow issues and needs to get some cash into the business quickly. She reminds you that Hypothetical Marketing is struggling a bit at the moment and saving some money on this contract could be really helpful for the company. She also tells you that it would be beneficial for you if you could help the company save somemoney so early in your employment. You know lots about the situation at Paperclips123 — you wrote its financial strategy just a couple of months ago! Can you share with Sofia some information about Paperclips123?​</a>

Case Study Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. is the leading wholesale distributor of construction supplies in the Philippines, and one of the country's largest distributors of hardware equipment, tools, and other interior and exterior building commodities and related products. The business started in late 1980's and grown its countrywide organization with more than 369 facilities and branches in most of the cities in the Philippines. The business venture reached over P50 billion sales and has existing four ISO certifications, certificates which issued to companies with enhanced quality management system. It has over 8,000 direct-hired employees who stayed for an average of 12 years in the company due to better staffing approach and retention programs. Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. in Pampanga market, which included 12 different stores, required instantaneous provisional workers to convene their staffing demands due to natural hazards and risks such as typhoon and earthquakes that happened in Pampanga in the summer of 2019. Previously, the company had never outsourced a temporary recruitment agency domestically for their staffing motives, however due to the exigency, the company executives decided to tie up with human resource staffing agencies. High number of competent workers needed is the main reason of the decision of company to come up in partnering with staffing firms to acquire the lack of workforce they had locally in their Human Resource department. The competency, educational attainment, and job experience of the needed employees were an extensive range which requires various recruitment personnel to handle each. The following job vacancies include purchasing, sales, warehouse managers, general labours and clerical employees. Time frame of two weeks was set up to deliver a total of 175 employees in the first month. Questions: 1. Describe the main challenge/s of Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc.?​</h2><br />

Your previous job was at a large office supplies company, Paperclips123, where you worked in the finance department and were involved in developing strategy and producing the annual report. Hypothetical Marketing has a contract with Paperclips123 to supply all office supplies, and the contract is up for renewal. The head of procurement, Sofia, asks you for a meeting to discuss the contract renewal. This isn’t out of the ordinary — you know that part of your new role is to discuss any important contract renewals with Sofia to ensure you’re on the same page on budget and key contract clauses. In the meeting, Sofia asks you for your take on Paperclips123’s current financial performance and strategy. She thinks that the company might be willing to compromise on price in return for better payment terms — there has been a rumour that Paperclips123 has cash flow issues and needs to get some cash into the business quickly. She reminds you that Hypothetical Marketing is struggling a bit at the moment and saving some money on this contract could be really helpful for the company. She also tells you that it would be beneficial for you if you could help the company save somemoney so early in your employment. You know lots about the situation at Paperclips123 — you wrote its financial strategy just a couple of months ago! Can you share with Sofia some information about Paperclips123?​</h2><br />
