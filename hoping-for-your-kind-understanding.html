                                            Organizing Your Text Before you start to write anything, take some time to plan your paragraphs. It is important to arrange your ideas and other details so that they will be presented in an organized way. This will make it easier for your reader to understand what you have written. Isn't it difficult to piece all your thoughts together when you have a lot to say? But if you have a framework to follow, you can arrange your points according to it. You no longer have to worry about your thoughts and ideas being muddled in the same paragraph. If you do not know of any kind of writing framework, don't worry. That's what this module is for. We shall go over several types of frameworks and you can choose your own for the next time you write something. In this lesson, you shall be introduced to the different kinds of rhetorical patterns of organization to help you plan the structure of your paragraphs. Hope you are ready!​</a>

                                            Below is an example of a Feature Article. Read, understand, then answer the questions Welcome to the now normal By: Ar. Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era. Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

                                            Below is an example of a Feature Article. Read, understand, then answer the questions Welcome to the now normal By: Ar. Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

                            2. Organizing Your Text Before you start to write anything, take some time to plan your paragraphs. It is important to arrange your ideas and other details so that they will be presented in an organized way. This will make it easier for your reader to understand what you have written. Isn't it difficult to piece all your thoughts together when you have a lot to say? But if you have a framework to follow, you can arrange your points according to it. You no longer have to worry about your thoughts and ideas being muddled in the same paragraph. If you do not know of any kind of writing framework, don't worry. That's what this module is for. We shall go over several types of frameworks and you can choose your own for the next time you write something. In this lesson, you shall be introduced to the different kinds of rhetorical patterns of organization to help you plan the structure of your paragraphs. Hope you are ready!​</h2><br />

                            5. Below is an example of a Feature Article. Read, understand, then answer the questions Welcome to the now normal By: Ar. Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era. Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2.) C. wish-can | 'Hope' mainly expresses a desire that is possible or likely to happen. 'Wish' usually expresses a desire that is impossible or unlikely to happen. 'Can' is used for present tense, while 'could' is past tense. Considering they are currently students talking about wishing to go to planets and space in general, it's in the present form. Being a student is an unlikely situation for you to be in outer space, let alone going to Mars.</p><p>3.) C. Adjectives | An adjective is a word used to modify or describe a noun or a pronoun. It usually answers the question of which one, what kind, or how many. Adverbs are adjectives that modify (describe) a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or even an entire phrase. Pronouns replace nouns, and verbs are action words.</p><p>4.) C. A new bicycle was bought by Kevin </p><p>5.) C.
