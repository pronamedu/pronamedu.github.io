                                            CHOOS3 THE ANSWER IN THE BOX NASA PIC PO ANG BOX6. Nature, in all its unbound glory, plays a huge role in Romantic literature. Nature sometimes seen as the opposite of the rational, is a powerful symbol in work from this era. Romantic poets and writers give personal, deep descriptions of nature and its wild and powerful qualities. 7. Romantic literature also explores the theme of aesthetic beauty, not just of nature but of people as well. 8. Writers of the Romantic era are believed that creative inspiration came from solitary exploration. They celebrated the feeling of being alone, whether that meant loneliness or a much-needed quiet space to think and create. 9. Romantic - era literature often has a distinct focus on exotic locations and events or items from history. Poems and prose touch on an antiques and gifts of ancient cultures around the world, and far - away locations provide the setting for some literary works of this era. Great example is Percy Byssche Shelley's poem Ozyamndias". 10. The writers of the Romantic era did not turn away from the darker side of emotion and the mysteries of the supernatural. They explore the contrast between life and death. ​</a>

                            10. CHOOS3 THE ANSWER IN THE BOX NASA PIC PO ANG BOX6. Nature, in all its unbound glory, plays a huge role in Romantic literature. Nature sometimes seen as the opposite of the rational, is a powerful symbol in work from this era. Romantic poets and writers give personal, deep descriptions of nature and its wild and powerful qualities. 7. Romantic literature also explores the theme of aesthetic beauty, not just of nature but of people as well. 8. Writers of the Romantic era are believed that creative inspiration came from solitary exploration. They celebrated the feeling of being alone, whether that meant loneliness or a much-needed quiet space to think and create. 9. Romantic - era literature often has a distinct focus on exotic locations and events or items from history. Poems and prose touch on an antiques and gifts of ancient cultures around the world, and far - away locations provide the setting for some literary works of this era. Great example is Percy Byssche Shelley's poem Ozyamndias". 10. The writers of the Romantic era did not turn away from the darker side of emotion and the mysteries of the supernatural. They explore the contrast between life and death. ​</h2><br />
