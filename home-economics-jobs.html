Juvenile Delinquency
Juvenile delinquency refers to the anti-social act or behavior which is against the norm, culture, customs
and regulations of the society and is committed by the youths (Guevara and Bautista, 2008).
According to Villanueva (2006), "Juvenile delinquency is a major problem that a society suffers from and
will continue to suffer until there is a significant social and economic change taking place".
Ngale (2009) emphasizes that "monitoring becomes increasingly important as children move into
adolescence and spend less time under the direct supervision of parents or other adults and more time with peer."
Smith, Tolan, Loeber &amp; Henry (1998) find that parental conflict and paternal aggressiveness predicted violent
offending, whereas lack of maternal affection and paternal criminality predicted involvement in property crimes.
In addition, Ngale (2009) says that "juvenile delinquent acts are the direct consequences of their family's
economic disempowerment, permissive parenting style, and parent's heavy job-time overload".
Moreover, Ngale (2009) reveals that in the absence of moral, psychological and financial viability at home,
the children are forced to seek to "survive" beyond the family context. Juvenile delinquency in this case is an
escape from a family system which is neither empowered nor empowering.

                                            PART TIL EVALUATION WORKSHEETS A. Directions: Read and analyze the article about "Corona Virus Disease – 19" below. Pick and write in the box provided some 2 evidences that supports the article. Corona Virus Disease - 19 The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. We have now reached the tragic milestone of one million deaths, and the human family is suffering under an almost intolerable burden of loss. “The climbing death toll is staggering, and we must work together to slow the spread of this virus." - UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. But the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, it's also an unprecedented socio-economic crisis. Stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political effects that will leave deep and longstanding scars. UNDP is the technical lead in the UN's socio-economic recovery, alongside the health response, led by WHO, and the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and working under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinators. Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 400 million jobs could be lost. The World Bank projects a US$110 billion decline in remittances this year, which could mean 800 million people will not be able to meet their basic needs.(Retrieved from: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/coronavirus.html)​</a>

Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper in lessthan200 words.Bases for rating:Substance - 15 pointsCoherence- 5 pointsRelevance - 5 pointsTotal - 25 pointsFactors related to globalization can also cause workers to migrate from their homelandsin poorer countries to more developed countries to find work. The migrant laborers mayleave their families and live temporarily in another country, thus disrupting the familyand social fabric of their home communities. Furthermore, most of their earnings may besent home, reducing the benefits their employment could have in the country where theyare employed. Often foreign workers immigrate to another country and, because theylive in their own neighborhoods, continue to follow their religions, customs, and evenfollow their own laws, they are sometimes accused of not being willing to adapt andaccept their new country. On the other hand, often these newcomers complain that theyare poorly treated and cannot live the way they would like in the more developedcountries they have immigrated to. Many developing countries need new industries andthe jobs these industries bring to improve their economies through globalization, but theydo not want to lose their own culture and identity in the process. Many developingcountries fear that increased globalization may lead to loss of control over economic andpolitical decisions and may also threaten their traditions, language, and culture. Withthe predominance of American pop culture as well as political and economic influencearound the world, many developing countries see globalization as a form of"Americanization" or "Westernization that is undermining the fabric of their traditionalsocieties. In addition, many developing countries do not have stringent rules aboutenvironmental protection, thus, industries do not need expensive pollution controlequipment, resulting in serious air, water, and soil pollution that would not beacceptable.Commentary: ​</a>

                                            Corona Virus Disease - 19 The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. We have now reached the tragic milestone of one million deaths, and the human family is suffering under an almost intolerable burden of loss. "The climbing dcath toll is staggering, and we must work together to slow the spread of this virus." - UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. But the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, it's also an unprecedented socio- economic crisis. Stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political effects that will leave deep and longstanding scars. UNDP is the technical lead in the UN's socio-economic recovery, alongside the health response, led by WHO, and the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and working under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinators. Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 400 million jobs could be lost. The World Bank projects a US$110 billion decline in remittances this year, which could mean 800 million people will not be able to meet their basic needs.(Retrieved from: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/coronavirus.html)​</a>

Juvenile Delinquency
Juvenile delinquency refers to the anti-social act or behavior which is against the norm, culture, customs
and regulations of the society and is committed by the youths (Guevara and Bautista, 2008).
According to Villanueva (2006), "Juvenile delinquency is a major problem that a society suffers from and
will continue to suffer until there is a significant social and economic change taking place".
Ngale (2009) emphasizes that "monitoring becomes increasingly important as children move into
adolescence and spend less time under the direct supervision of parents or other adults and more time with peer."
Smith, Tolan, Loeber &amp; Henry (1998) find that parental conflict and paternal aggressiveness predicted violent
offending, whereas lack of maternal affection and paternal criminality predicted involvement in property crimes.
In addition, Ngale (2009) says that "juvenile delinquent acts are the direct consequences of their family's
economic disempowerment, permissive parenting style, and parent's heavy job-time overload".
Moreover, Ngale (2009) reveals that in the absence of moral, psychological and financial viability at home,
the children are forced to seek to "survive" beyond the family context. Juvenile delinquency in this case is an
escape from a family system which is neither empowered nor empowering.

                            9. Juvenile delinquency refers to the anti-social act or behavior which is against the norm, culture, customs and regulations of the society and is committed by the youths (Guevara and Bautista, 2008).According to Villanueva (2006), "Juvenile delinquency is a major problem that a society suffers from and will continue to suffer until there is a significant social and economic change taking place".Ngale (2009) emphasizes that "monitoring becomes increasingly important as children move into adolescence and spend less time under the direct supervision of parents or other adults and more time with peer."Smith, Tolan, Loeber &amp; Henry (1998) find that parental conflict and paternal aggressiveness predicted violent offending, whereas lack of maternal affection and paternal criminality predicted involvement in property crimes.In addition, Ngale (2009) says that "juvenile delinquent acts are the direct consequences of their family's economic disempowerment, permissive parenting style, and parent's heavy job-time overload".Moreover, Ngale (2009) reveals that in the absence of moral, psychological and financial viability at home, the children are forced to seek to "survive" beyond the family context. Juvenile delinquency in this case is an escape from a family system which is neither empowered nor empowering​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)The general statement presented in the passage is that juvenile delinquency is a significant problem in society, which is caused by various factors such as lack of parental supervision, family dysfunction, economic disempowerment, and permissive parenting style.</p><p></p><p>3.)The writer supports the general statement by citing various sources and studies that emphasize the factors that contribute to juvenile delinquency. For example, Guevara and Bautista (2008) define juvenile delinquency, while Villanueva (2006) highlights that it is a significant problem that requires social and economic change. Ngale (2009) stresses the importance of monitoring children's behavior during adolescence when they spend less time under direct adult supervision. Smith et al. (1998) conducted a study that found that different types of delinquent behavior were predicted by parental conflict, paternal aggressiveness, lack of maternal affection, and paternal criminality. Furthermore, Ngale (2009) argues that juvenile delinquency is often a consequence of economic disempowerment, permissive parenting, and family dysfunction. Finally, Ngale (2009) suggests that juvenile delinquency may be an attempt by children to escape an unempowered or disempowering family system, due to the absence of moral, psychological, and financial viability at home.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>your question # 2 is incomplete </p><br />

                            22. PART TIL EVALUATION WORKSHEETS A. Directions: Read and analyze the article about "Corona Virus Disease – 19" below. Pick and write in the box provided some 2 evidences that supports the article. Corona Virus Disease - 19 The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. We have now reached the tragic milestone of one million deaths, and the human family is suffering under an almost intolerable burden of loss. “The climbing death toll is staggering, and we must work together to slow the spread of this virus." - UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. But the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, it's also an unprecedented socio-economic crisis. Stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political effects that will leave deep and longstanding scars. UNDP is the technical lead in the UN's socio-economic recovery, alongside the health response, led by WHO, and the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and working under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinators. Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 400 million jobs could be lost. The World Bank projects a US$110 billion decline in remittances this year, which could mean 800 million people will not be able to meet their basic needs.(Retrieved from: https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/coronavirus.html)​</h2><br />

Globalization--Positive or Negative? That isthe question! Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper in lessthan200 words.Bases for rating:Substance - 15 pointsCoherence- 5 pointsRelevance - 5 pointsTotal - 25 pointsFactors related to globalization can also cause workers to migrate from their homelandsin poorer countries to more developed countries to find work. The migrant laborers mayleave their families and live temporarily in another country, thus disrupting the familyand social fabric of their home communities. Furthermore, most of their earnings may besent home, reducing the benefits their employment could have in the country where theyare employed. Often foreign workers immigrate to another country and, because theylive in their own neighborhoods, continue to follow their religions, customs, and evenfollow their own laws, they are sometimes accused of not being willing to adapt andaccept their new country. On the other hand, often these newcomers complain that theyare poorly treated and cannot live the way they would like in the more developedcountries they have immigrated to. Many developing countries need new industries andthe jobs these industries bring to improve their economies through globalization, but theydo not want to lose their own culture and identity in the process. Many developingcountries fear that increased globalization may lead to loss of control over economic andpolitical decisions and may also threaten their traditions, language, and culture. Withthe predominance of American pop culture as well as political and economic influencearound the world, many developing countries see globalization as a form of"Americanization" or "Westernization that is undermining the fabric of their traditionalsocieties. In addition, many developing countries do not have stringent rules aboutenvironmental protection, thus, industries do not need expensive pollution controlequipment, resulting in serious air, water, and soil pollution that would not beacceptable.Commentary: ​</h2><br />
