This tool is useful for a variety of tasks, including: bending angles in wire and sheet, holding small beads, holding bezel wire during filing, and opening and closing jump rings. 2. This tool is for cutting wire or small pieces of sheetstock. This is the most commonly used cutter and is available in standard bevel cut, flush cut and super flush cut. 3. It is useful in measuring in making necklaces in terms of length. 4. This tool is used to secure crimps tightly and neatly where the crimp made is more rounded than a crimp made with flat-nose pliers. 5. This tool is designed specifically for cutting casting sprues. The compound joint and spring action provide maximum leverage with minimum effort. Also useful for cutting thick stock and hard materials. 6. This tool come in handy to pick up tiny beads and for holding pieces in one hand while applying glue with the other. 7. This tool is most preferred by some people over chain nose pliers because the bent jaws provide better access to tight areas. Especially useful for "tucking in" wire ends in beads. 8. This tool is similar in design to end cutters, but with jaws that are slightly offset to one side. The offset provides increased clearance. Available in flush cut and super flush cut versions 9. This tool is used to thread tiny beads for smaller size, thicker threads for the use of large beads. 10. This tool is typically used by beading artists where it is a combination of round nose plier and side cutter. The round jaws are great for wrapping wire and holding beading cord, while the integrated cutter means you don't have to switch tools as often. 11. In this tool the cutting edges are set at right angles to provide easier access to tight areas Better suited to cutting protruding wire ends than diagonal cutters. 12. This tool is suitable for gluing knots and ribbon to prevent fraying. 13. This tool is perfectly suited for getting into tight areas and for precision work. Useful for opening small jump rings, bending thin gauge wire, and holding small beads. 14. In this cutter style require less force and leave a small pinch, but are not as strong and wear faster 15. This tool is used to keep beads and other small materials and findings​</a>

This tool is useful for a variety of tasks, including: bending angles in wire and sheet, holding small beads, holding bezel wire during filing, and opening and closing jump rings. 2. This tool is for cutting wire or small pieces of sheetstock. This is the most commonly used cutter and is available in standard bevel cut, flush cut and super flush cut. 3. It is useful in measuring in making necklaces in terms of length. 4. This tool is used to secure crimps tightly and neatly where the crimp made is more rounded than a crimp made with flat-nose pliers. 5. This tool is designed specifically for cutting casting sprues. The compound joint and spring action provide maximum leverage with minimum effort. Also useful for cutting thick stock and hard materials. 6. This tool come in handy to pick up tiny beads and for holding pieces in one hand while applying glue with the other. 7. This tool is most preferred by some people over chain nose pliers because the bent jaws provide better access to tight areas. Especially useful for "tucking in" wire ends in beads. 8. This tool is similar in design to end cutters, but with jaws that are slightly offset to one side. The offset provides increased clearance. Available in flush cut and super flush cut versions 9. This tool is used to thread tiny beads for smaller size, thicker threads for the use of large beads. 10. This tool is typically used by beading artists where it is a combination of round nose plier and side cutter. The round jaws are great for wrapping wire and holding beading cord, while the integrated cutter means you don't have to switch tools as often. 11. In this tool the cutting edges are set at right angles to provide easier access to tight areas Better suited to cutting protruding wire ends than diagonal cutters. 12. This tool is suitable for gluing knots and ribbon to prevent fraying. 13. This tool is perfectly suited for getting into tight areas and for precision work. Useful for opening small jump rings, bending thin gauge wire, and holding small beads. 14. In this cutter style require less force and leave a small pinch, but are not as strong and wear faster 15. This tool is used to keep beads and other small materials and findings​</h2><br />
