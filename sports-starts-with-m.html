Athletes like e able to get the most out of their high school years because we c ake memories without doing bad things. Most of all students lear w to manage school work, how to be a role model and build char r a life time. Grades are important no matter if students are in sports or not udents have to realize in order to play a sport they have to keep th ades up. This helps the kids stay on task in class and keep them o puble. With more pressure on the students to do good kids have to arn how to manage their time. For instance if they have seminar t arn to stay busy and not do unproductive things. Students out for orts may have a better chance at getting help. Like if their practic esn't start right after school they can get help after school or if th end is in the sport they can get help from them also. I have learne th being in basketball that staying after school can help me complish the homework that I am having trouble with. All kids look up to their high school sports teams. When they Friday night football game they are there playing with their frienc scussing how cool it's going to be when they get that old. Young atch their older bothers and sisters and see that they are having fu akes them want to go out for it. That is why it is important for stu try their hardest in sports.

Students also learn important skills such as time management and being a role model, while grades remain important for participation in sports.<p></p><strong>Counter argument</strong>: The author acknowledges that there is more pressure on students in sports to do well academically, but argues that this helps them stay on task and avoid getting into trouble.<p></p><strong>Evidence</strong>: Students in sports may have more opportunities for academic support, such as help from coaches or teammates. The author also notes their own personal experience with staying after school for basketball practice and getting help with homework.<p></p><strong>Moral lessons</strong>: The text emphasizes the importance of teamwork and setting a good example for younger students who look up to high school athletes. It also suggests that sports can teach important life skills and provide a positive outlet for students.<br />
