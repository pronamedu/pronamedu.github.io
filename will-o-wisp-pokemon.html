The waters of the lake are a rich purple, but the purple changes hue with the time of the day and the condition of the weather. Taal Volcano is set squarely in the middle, but it looks so tiny as seen from the ridge that many have asked on seeing it. What is that?" After all, Taal is perhaps the smallest volcano crate.

                                            (From the Tinguian Story)Monina A. MercadoAponi-tolau, lord of the mountains, was bored with the view from the peak. When he looked up on a clear day, there was nothingbut brilliant blue skies. On days when rain threatened, there was nothing but dark billowing clouds. When days were just right - neithertoo sunny nor too cloudy - bunches of white clouds or wisps here and there touched the sky. It was so boring.When Aponi-tolau looked down, the plains were rolling green as if it was the time of rains and brilliant ocher; as if it was thesummer. As far as his eyes could see, there was just the Earth, crossed here and there with a silver river or two. The view never changed,whether he looked up or down from the mountain top.From the time Aponi-tolau was a little boy, he had to live at the highest peak, for he was the lord of the mountains. His motherwas Langaan, goddess of the wind and the rain. She was delighted that her son lived at the peak, for there she could send the NorthWind to caress him awake, the South Wind ti sing him to sleep, the showers of May to cool his brow, and the monsoon rains of July todeepen the forests that sheltered him.Now a young man, Aponi-tolau was restless. He wanted to see new places and meet new people, walk on the flat earth of theplains, run and feel the earth and the grass beneath his feet. There was no place to walk at the mountain peak and nowhere to run. If hewalked farther than the front yard of his home, the earth dropped down the mountain slope. If he was adventurous and walked beyondthe backyard, there was a sheer drop of rock down the stone face of the mountain. It was so boring.One day, Aponi-tolau ran away from the mountain peak. He hurried down the slope, running down than walking. Down, downthe slope he plunged. His eagerness gave him wings. Soon, he was on the plains. He walked on, close at last to the fields that lookedlike green tapestry from on high, to the trees that looked like puffy green blossoms from afar, and to people who looked like moving dollsfrom the peak. One day, he followed the course of a river. He wanted to see where it went from its silent pools beneath lush tress, fromits cascades, and from its rills among great shiny rocks. The river brought him to the sea. Never before had been so close to the sea.How wondrous it was! As he stood on the sand, waves from the distant blue rushed in, rising high and racing each other to the shore.But, when they came near to Aponi-tolau, the waves broke and bowed, slipped gently in and touched his feet with small, shy and delicatekisses.Aponi-tolau was bewitched. He must go into the sea and sail into the deep. He must follow it to the very end of its blue distance?.what is tha exposition​</a>

When he revived, he waslying in the hot sun on the middle of a gardenpath, very bedraggled indeed, and a small boyand his mother were standing over him.3 “Let’s take him in and dry him,” said the mother.4 They took him into the house, and wrapped himin a cloth, and warmed him over a little fire, andhe opened his eyes and sneezed.5 “Now,” said the father, “don’t frighten him, andwe’ll see what he’ll do.”6 It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten amongoose, because he is eaten up from nose totail with curiosity. The motto of all the mongoosefamily is “Run and find out,” and Rikki-tikki wasa true mongoose. He looked at the cloth, decidedthat it was not good to eat, ran all round thetable, sat up and put his fur in order, scratchedhimself, and jumped on the small boy’s shoulder.7 “Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father.“That’s his way of making friends.”8 “Ouch! He’s tickling under my chin,” said Teddy.9 Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collarand neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down tothe floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.10 “Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’sa wild creature! I suppose he’s so tame becausewe’ve been kind to him.”1. _________________________________________________________________________2. _________________________________________________________________________3. _________________________________________________________________________4. _________________________________________________________________________5. _________________________________________________________________________Please Help Mee​</a>

The waters of the lake are a rich purple, but the purple changes hue with the time of the day and the condition of the weather. Taal Volcano is set squarely in the middle, but it looks so tiny as seen from the ridge that many have asked on seeing it. What is that?" After all, Taal is perhaps the smallest volcano crate.

Not only when the moon shines, but on dark nights too. As the fireflies fly to and fro, and even when it rains, how beautiful it is!In autumn the evenings when the glittering sun sinks close to the edge of the hills and the crows fly back to their nest in threes,and fours,and twos; more charming still a file of wild geese, like specks in the distant sky. When the sun has set, one's heart is moved by the sound of the wind and the hum of the insects.In winter rhe early mornings, It is beautiful indeed when snow has fallen during the night, but splendid too, when the ground is white with frost; or even when there is no snow or frost, but it is simply very cold and the attendants hurry from room to room stirring up the fires the bringing charcoal, how well this fits the season's mood! but as noon approaches and the cold wears off, no one bothers to keep the braziers alight, and soon nothing remains but piles of white ashes.questions:1.does the author show preference for a particular season? prove your answer.2.Based on the author's description, which season do you prefer and why?3.state the topic sentence or the main ide of each paragraph.​</h2><br />

In summer the nights. Not only when the moon shines, but on dark nights, too. As the fireflies fly to and fro, and even when it rains, how beautiful it is! 
In autumn the evenings, when the glittering sun sinks close to the edge of the hills and the crows fly back to their nests in threes, and fours, and twos; more charming still is a file of wild geese, like specks in the distant sky. When the sun has set, one’s heart is moved by the sound of the wind and the hum of the insects. 
In winter the early mornings. It is beautiful indeed when snow has fallen during the night, but splendid, too, when the ground is white with frost; or even when there is no snow or frost, but it is simply very cold and the attendants hurry from room to room stirring up the fires and bringing charcoal, how well this fits the season’s mood!

As the light creeps over the hills, their outlinesare dyed a faint red and wisps of purplish cloud trail over them.In summer the nights. Not only when the moon shines, but on dark nights, too. As thefireflies fly to and fro, and even when it rains, how beautiful it is!In autumn the evenings, when the glittering sun sinks close to the edge of the hills and thecrows fly back to their nests in threes, and fours, and twos; more charming still is a file of wildgeese, like specks in the distant sky. When the sun has set, one's heart is moved by the sound ofthe wind and the hum of the insects.In winter the early mornings. It is beautiful indeed when snow has fallen during the night, butsplendid, too, when the ground is white with frost; or even when there is no snow or frost, but itis simply very cold and the attendants hurry from room to room stirring up the fires and bringingcharcoal, how well this fits the season's mood.

                            19. (From the Tinguian Story)Monina A. MercadoAponi-tolau, lord of the mountains, was bored with the view from the peak. When he looked up on a clear day, there was nothingbut brilliant blue skies. On days when rain threatened, there was nothing but dark billowing clouds. When days were just right - neithertoo sunny nor too cloudy - bunches of white clouds or wisps here and there touched the sky. It was so boring.When Aponi-tolau looked down, the plains were rolling green as if it was the time of rains and brilliant ocher; as if it was thesummer. As far as his eyes could see, there was just the Earth, crossed here and there with a silver river or two. The view never changed,whether he looked up or down from the mountain top.From the time Aponi-tolau was a little boy, he had to live at the highest peak, for he was the lord of the mountains. His motherwas Langaan, goddess of the wind and the rain. She was delighted that her son lived at the peak, for there she could send the NorthWind to caress him awake, the South Wind ti sing him to sleep, the showers of May to cool his brow, and the monsoon rains of July todeepen the forests that sheltered him.Now a young man, Aponi-tolau was restless. He wanted to see new places and meet new people, walk on the flat earth of theplains, run and feel the earth and the grass beneath his feet. There was no place to walk at the mountain peak and nowhere to run. If hewalked farther than the front yard of his home, the earth dropped down the mountain slope. If he was adventurous and walked beyondthe backyard, there was a sheer drop of rock down the stone face of the mountain. It was so boring.One day, Aponi-tolau ran away from the mountain peak. He hurried down the slope, running down than walking. Down, downthe slope he plunged. His eagerness gave him wings. Soon, he was on the plains. He walked on, close at last to the fields that lookedlike green tapestry from on high, to the trees that looked like puffy green blossoms from afar, and to people who looked like moving dollsfrom the peak. One day, he followed the course of a river. He wanted to see where it went from its silent pools beneath lush tress, fromits cascades, and from its rills among great shiny rocks. The river brought him to the sea. Never before had been so close to the sea.How wondrous it was! As he stood on the sand, waves from the distant blue rushed in, rising high and racing each other to the shore.But, when they came near to Aponi-tolau, the waves broke and bowed, slipped gently in and touched his feet with small, shy and delicatekisses.Aponi-tolau was bewitched. He must go into the sea and sail into the deep. He must follow it to the very end of its blue distance?.what is tha exposition​</h2><br />

The motto of all the mongoosefamily is “Run and find out,” and Rikki-tikki wasa true mongoose. He looked at the cloth, decidedthat it was not good to eat, ran all round thetable, sat up and put his fur in order, scratchedhimself, and jumped on the small boy’s shoulder.7 “Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father.“That’s his way of making friends.”8 “Ouch! He’s tickling under my chin,” said Teddy.9 Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collarand neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down tothe floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.10 “Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’sa wild creature!

The waters of the lake are a rich purple, but the purple changes hue with the time of the day and the condition of the weather. Taal Volcano is set squarely in the middle, but it looks so tiny as seen from the ridge that many have asked on seeing it. What is that?" After all, Taal is perhaps the smallest volcano crate.
