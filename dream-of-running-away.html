                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Encourage your friend to stay with his family. He is having a hard time dealing with everything and so as his family. He shouldn't think of impulsive things like leaving his own family for himself. His family loves him dearly that they are willing to do anything just for him to be able to achieve his Dreams. Problems like that are normal to happen. Every families experience that, but the only thing that helps them from going through it is, love for one another. If he truly loves his family he would stay with them, he would understand and even help to be able to get thru the challenges they're facing right now. That's what families are for. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>tell him/her everything that would go back to normal in someday</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>reason behind this is because if you imagine your life as a paper and that paper is very dirty you will look for another one which is just like running away  from home, where the ones that made you happy since you were a child and it's just like you want everything to be perfect but it's impossible which in the end would make you overwhelm </p><br />
