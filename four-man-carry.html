I just can’t help myself but to share to you a very beautiful
encounter I personally witnessed as I go to work.
You know, I have read a lot of posts in social media about cops
who become abusive of their power. One video that I watched
shows police brutality towards a bystander who allegedly
violated a protocol in this time of the pandemic. For not wearing
a mask, he was immediately detained. Others raged and asked
‘Could he be just fined?’ There was another
post about a ‘ginang’ who was accordingly detained after
having argued with a policeman. And many awkward and
untoward stories continue to surface that painted a bad image to our policemen.
I do not say that these stories are not true. But what I am pointing out here is
the fact that while some other policemen seem bad and abusive, majority of them
are not and are still working under their oath, that is to protect people from crimes.
One of the many good policemen happened to be the character of this good
encounter of mine.
I was on my way to work. It was difficult for me to flag down a taxi since it was
raining on that morning. I tried several times but the cabs could not just see me for
that part of the waiting shed was hidden by some trees plus the bad weather fog
seemed to darken that street. One, two, three, four times that I tried but still I could
not take one. I would be terribly late.
I was already hopeless when suddenly a police mobile came out from nowhere
and stopped at the side of the street. A man in uniform then came out from the car. I
guessed he was at his mid-40s.He had no umbrella but thank God the rain on that
moment wasn’t that hard to bathe him soon. He smiled at me and when he noticed
that a taxi was approaching, he made a sign for it to stop. It stopped. But what
surprised me and I didn’t expect more is when he took off his uniform and enveloped
me with it. So, I didn’t get moistened by rain as I got inside the cab. I thanked him for
his kindness and secretly read the name on his plate. ‘Macapagal, L.M.’ was
engraved on it. He nodded at me and assured that I owe nothing for his kindness.
He waved then as the car began to run. I will not forget that act of kindness.
When I reached home, I overheard our maids in the kitchen gigglingly talked
about a man who helped them carry their groceries after being stuck in the rain this
afternoon. According to Aling Carmen, our old maid, she would not surely forget the
name of that police guy for the rest of her life. As it was her first to receive such
kindness from a man of her dreams. But Aling Tessie, our jolly cook, teased Aling
Carmen that the police guy was only meant for herself and not for Aling Carmen.
And both of them giggled even more. When I asked them who this ‘knight with a
shining armor’ is they were talking about, both of them screamed ‘Macapagal, L.M!’
So, you see, it was the same guy who helped me earlier. Wow! It was just natural for that police guy to help! May many beautiful encounters continue to spread down the street!

She handed the man her package. He placed it on a creaky scale, turned a knob, and adjusted some weights. "One pound and four ounces," He said, writing down the number on a ledger. He did some multiplication on a notepad and looked up at her from behind his glasses. Then he asked, "It's going to Boston?" She nodded. "That'll be 44 cents." He said.

"Ti sorry this had to be done. I am sorry. But neither of us can help it. Tbc sound of the gangsas beat through the walls of the dark house like muted roars of Talling waters. The woman who had moved with a start when the sliding door opened had been hearing the gangsas for she did not know how long. There was a sudden rush of fire in her. She gave no sign that she heard Awivao but continued to sit unmoving in the darkness. But Awiyao knew that she heard him, and his heart pitied her. He crawled on all fours to the middle of the room; he knew exactly where the stove was. With bare fingers he stirred the covered smoldering embers and blew into the stove. When the coals began to glow, Awivao put pieces of pine on them, then full round logs as his arms. The room brightened. "Why don't you go out," he said, "and join the dancing women?" He felt a pang inside him, because what he said was really not the right thing to say and because the woman did not stir. "You should join the dancers," he said, "as if--as if nothing had happened." He looked at the woman haddled in a corner of the room, leaning against the wall. The stove fire played with strange moving shadows and lights upon her face. She was partly sullen, but her sullenness was not because of anger or hate. "Go out-go out and dance. If you really don't hate me for this separation, go out and dance, One of the men will see you dance well; he will like your dancing, he will marry you. Who knows but that, with him, you will be luckier than you were with me."? "I don't want any man," she said sharply. "I don't want any other man." He felt relieved that at least she talked: "You know very well that I won't want any other woman either. You know that don't you? Lunnay, you know it, don't you?" She did not answer him. "You know it Lumnay, don't you?" he repeated. "Yes, I know," she said weakly. "It is not my fault," he said, feeling relieved. "You cannot blame me; I have been a good husband to you."

You may modify the sample outline format presented before. This I Believe Carlos P. Romulo I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</a>

                                            Text Selection 1 The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil 82 no one could do Bailey bridge, as insolent than the jeepney, If one were looking for a symbol of postwar Philippines, c y, which is as abundant and as persistent as postwar mosquitoes, as noisy and dangerous as postwar politics, as useful as a b as a squatter, and as much a creature of improvisation as the postwar Filipino. de a shop on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion imaginative estimat the C C.1. Who is Carmen Guerrero Nakpil?2. How did the author describe jeepney?3. What does the jeepney symbolized?4.

Heunderwent a five-hour surgery and was able to fully recover.

Trees are beneficial to mankind. Trees help prevent water pollution. They control the sudden flow or rainfall into the earth below the tree. This prevents pollutants to be carried to the ocean. Trees act like sponge that filters this water naturally and uses it to recharge groundwater supplies. They lessen the noise from nearby streets and freeways and create an eye-soothing view of green. Trees absorb dust and wind and reduce glare. Trees conserve energy. Three trees placed strategically around a single- family home can cut summer air conditioning needs by up to 50 percent. By reducing the energy demand for cooling our houses, we reduce carbon dioxide and other pollution emissions from power plants. a b. What is the main idea of the text?

I just can’t help myself but to share to you a very beautiful
encounter I personally witnessed as I go to work.
You know, I have read a lot of posts in social media about cops
who become abusive of their power. One video that I watched
shows police brutality towards a bystander who allegedly
violated a protocol in this time of the pandemic. For not wearing
a mask, he was immediately detained. Others raged and asked
‘Could he be just fined?’ There was another
post about a ‘ginang’ who was accordingly detained after
having argued with a policeman. And many awkward and
untoward stories continue to surface that painted a bad image to our policemen.
I do not say that these stories are not true. But what I am pointing out here is
the fact that while some other policemen seem bad and abusive, majority of them
are not and are still working under their oath, that is to protect people from crimes.
One of the many good policemen happened to be the character of this good
encounter of mine.
I was on my way to work. It was difficult for me to flag down a taxi since it was
raining on that morning. I tried several times but the cabs could not just see me for
that part of the waiting shed was hidden by some trees plus the bad weather fog
seemed to darken that street. One, two, three, four times that I tried but still I could
not take one. I would be terribly late.
I was already hopeless when suddenly a police mobile came out from nowhere
and stopped at the side of the street. A man in uniform then came out from the car. I
guessed he was at his mid-40s.He had no umbrella but thank God the rain on that
moment wasn’t that hard to bathe him soon. He smiled at me and when he noticed
that a taxi was approaching, he made a sign for it to stop. It stopped. But what
surprised me and I didn’t expect more is when he took off his uniform and enveloped
me with it. So, I didn’t get moistened by rain as I got inside the cab. I thanked him for
his kindness and secretly read the name on his plate. ‘Macapagal, L.M.’ was
engraved on it. He nodded at me and assured that I owe nothing for his kindness.
He waved then as the car began to run. I will not forget that act of kindness.
When I reached home, I overheard our maids in the kitchen gigglingly talked
about a man who helped them carry their groceries after being stuck in the rain this
afternoon. According to Aling Carmen, our old maid, she would not surely forget the
name of that police guy for the rest of her life. As it was her first to receive such
kindness from a man of her dreams. But Aling Tessie, our jolly cook, teased Aling
Carmen that the police guy was only meant for herself and not for Aling Carmen.
And both of them giggled even more. When I asked them who this ‘knight with a
shining armor’ is they were talking about, both of them screamed ‘Macapagal, L.M!’
So, you see, it was the same guy who helped me earlier. Wow! It was just natural for that police guy to help! May many beautiful encounters continue to spread down the street!

He placed it on a creaky scale, turned a knob, and adjusted some weights. "One pound and four ounces," He said, writing down the number on a ledger. He did some multiplication on a notepad and looked up at her from behind his glasses. Then he asked, "It's going to Boston?" She nodded. "That'll be 44 cents." He said.

"Ti sorry this had to be done. I am sorry. But neither of us can help it. Tbc sound of the gangsas beat through the walls of the dark house like muted roars of Talling waters. The woman who had moved with a start when the sliding door opened had been hearing the gangsas for she did not know how long. There was a sudden rush of fire in her. She gave no sign that she heard Awivao but continued to sit unmoving in the darkness. But Awiyao knew that she heard him, and his heart pitied her. He crawled on all fours to the middle of the room; he knew exactly where the stove was. With bare fingers he stirred the covered smoldering embers and blew into the stove. When the coals began to glow, Awivao put pieces of pine on them, then full round logs as his arms. The room brightened. "Why don't you go out," he said, "and join the dancing women?" He felt a pang inside him, because what he said was really not the right thing to say and because the woman did not stir. "You should join the dancers," he said, "as if--as if nothing had happened." He looked at the woman haddled in a corner of the room, leaning against the wall. The stove fire played with strange moving shadows and lights upon her face. She was partly sullen, but her sullenness was not because of anger or hate. "Go out-go out and dance. If you really don't hate me for this separation, go out and dance, One of the men will see you dance well; he will like your dancing, he will marry you. Who knows but that, with him, you will be luckier than you were with me."? "I don't want any man," she said sharply. "I don't want any other man." He felt relieved that at least she talked: "You know very well that I won't want any other woman either. You know that don't you? Lunnay, you know it, don't you?" She did not answer him. "You know it Lumnay, don't you?" he repeated. "Yes, I know," she said weakly. "It is not my fault," he said, feeling relieved. "You cannot blame me; I have been a good husband to you."

You may modify the sample outline format presented before. This I Believe Carlos P. Romulo I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</h2><br />

                            25. Text Selection 1 The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil 82 no one could do Bailey bridge, as insolent than the jeepney, If one were looking for a symbol of postwar Philippines, c y, which is as abundant and as persistent as postwar mosquitoes, as noisy and dangerous as postwar politics, as useful as a b as a squatter, and as much a creature of improvisation as the postwar Filipino. de a shop on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion imaginative estimat the C C.1. Who is Carmen Guerrero Nakpil?2. How did the author describe jeepney?3. What does the jeepney symbolized?4.

                        1. Carmen Guerrero Nakpil is the author of the text "The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity."<br /><br />2. The author described the jeepney as a flamboyant, abundantly decorated vehicle that is noisy, crowded, and dangerous. It can carry six to ten passengers, and sometimes up to twelve, and is a creature of improvisation and ingenuity.<br /><br />3. The jeepney symbolizes postwar Philippines, with its abundance, persistence, usefulness, and improvisation. It is a product of Filipino ingenuity and resourcefulness, and a reflection of the country's history and culture.<br /><br />4. The text does not provide a direct answer to this question, but it does highlight the jeepney's usefulness, creativity, and cultural significance.<br /><br />5. As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, the proposed phase-out of jeepneys is a controversial issue that has sparked debates and protests in the Philippines. Supporters argue that it is necessary to modernize the public transportation system and reduce air pollution, while critics argue that it will displace thousands of drivers and harm small businesses.<br />

John Paul II even worked for his eventual release and deportationto Turkey in 2000 where he served an additional ten years in prison for themurder of Ipekci and other crimes.

                            30. Learning Task 2. Carefully read the paragraph below. Answer the questions that follow. Write the letter of the correct answer on your answer sheet. Trees are beneficial to mankind. Trees help prevent water pollution. They control the sudden flow or rainfall into the earth below the tree. This prevents pollutants to be carried to the ocean. Trees act like sponge that filters this water naturally and uses it to recharge groundwater supplies. They lessen the noise from nearby streets and freeways and create an eye-soothing view of green. Trees absorb dust and wind and reduce glare. Trees conserve energy. Three trees placed strategically around a single- family home can cut summer air conditioning needs by up to 50 percent. By reducing the energy demand for cooling our houses, we reduce carbon dioxide and other pollution emissions from power plants. a b. What is the main idea of the text? Trees need lots of attention and care. Trees help man in many ways. Trees are of no use. C. 2. List down the four points (supporting details) given by the author to prove the main idea.
