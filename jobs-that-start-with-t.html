                                            A rocket designed to place small payloads into orbit is carried to an altitude of 12.0 km above sea level by a converted airliner. When the airliner is flying in a straight line at a constant speed of 850 km/h, the rocket is dropped. After the drop, the airliner maintains the same altitude and speed and continues to fly in a straight line. The rocket falls for a brief time, after which its rocket motor turns on. Once that motor is on, the combined effects of thrust and gravity give the rocket a constant acceleration of magnitude 3.00g directed at an angle of 30.0° above the horizontal. For safety, the rocket should be at least 1.00 km in front of the airliner when it climbs through the airliner’s altitude. Your job is to determine the minimum time that the rocket must fall before its engine starts. Ignore air resistance. Your answer should include (i) a diagram showing the flight paths of both the rocket and the airliner, labeled at several points with vectors for their velocities and accelerations; (ii) an x-t graph showing the motions of both the rocket and the airliner; and (iii) a y-t graph showing the motions of both the rocket and the airliner. On the diagram and the graphs, indicate when the rocket is dropped, when the rocket motor turns on, and when the rocket climbs through the altitude of the airliner.​</a>

Follow this same type of format to write your journal entries. Notice how the journal entry describes everyday tasks and technologies about our present day. Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</a>

It generally defines art produced after the Modern Art movement to the present day. However, modern artwork is not just art produced during a specific time-frame. This genre of art does have its own approach or style that distinguishes it from others. </p><p></p><p>Yet, this style of art is difficult to define because it includes such variety. Some argue that the basic approach and goal of modern Art is to challenge the nature of artwork itself. It can also make the viewer question what it is that defines art. Therefore, this style of art is not particularly uniform, and it may be more challenging to precisely describe than any other genre of art. Additionally, there are several major reasons to why contempory art is important to society, for instance it is a mean to express oneself as it is way to provide social and cultural commentary. </p><br />

                            8. A rocket designed to place small payloads into orbit is carried to an altitude of 12.0 km above sea level by a converted airliner. When the airliner is flying in a straight line at a constant speed of 850 km/h, the rocket is dropped. After the drop, the airliner maintains the same altitude and speed and continues to fly in a straight line. The rocket falls for a brief time, after which its rocket motor turns on. Once that motor is on, the combined effects of thrust and gravity give the rocket a constant acceleration of magnitude 3.00g directed at an angle of 30.0° above the horizontal. For safety, the rocket should be at least 1.00 km in front of the airliner when it climbs through the airliner’s altitude. Your job is to determine the minimum time that the rocket must fall before its engine starts. Ignore air resistance. Your answer should include (i) a diagram showing the flight paths of both the rocket and the airliner, labeled at several points with vectors for their velocities and accelerations; (ii) an x-t graph showing the motions of both the rocket and the airliner; and (iii) a y-t graph showing the motions of both the rocket and the airliner. On the diagram and the graphs, indicate when the rocket is dropped, when the rocket motor turns on, and when the rocket climbs through the altitude of the airliner.​</h2><br />

Follow this same type of format to write your journal entries. Notice how the journal entry describes everyday tasks and technologies about our present day. Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</h2><br />

</p><p>laughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that the
</p><p>
</p><p>theatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!
</p><p>
</p><p>My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. We
</p><p>
</p><p>had only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect her
</p><p>
</p><p>home so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.
</p><p>
</p><p>It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called to
</p><p>
</p><p>see if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then met
</p><p>
</p><p>Danielle at her house.
</p><p>
</p><p>While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,
</p><p>
</p><p>a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for much
</p><p>
</p><p>longer since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was a
</p><p>
</p><p>fun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</p><p></p><br />
