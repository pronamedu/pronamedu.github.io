Write your answers on sheet of paper.Mrs. Reyes assigned the Grade 4 class in Math to find out howquadrilaterals are related to one another, so she grouped the classinto two. The first group was assigned to prepare cut-outs of different quadrilaterals like square, rhombus, parallelogram, rectangle and trapezoid. The other group was assigned to enumerate its similarities and differences by writing down the different properties of each quadrilateral. As the group finished working cooperatively and collaborately, they found all the characteristics of quadrilaterals and relate each figure to one another. They found out that both square and rhombus has 4 equal sides. But a square has 4 right angles while rhombus has no right angles.pasagot naman po ng tama ibrabrainlest ko po ang mag sasagot nyan asa pic po yung tanong​</a>

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>1) Yes, all squares are similar because they have equal angles and their sides are proportional to each other. This means that if you scale up or down a square, its angles will remain the same and its sides will maintain the same ratios.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2) No, not all rectangles are similar because they can have different angles and side ratios. Similarity in rectangles depends on whether their corresponding angles are equal and their sides are proportional to each other.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3) Yes, all equilateral triangles are similar because they have equal angles and their sides are proportional to each other. This means that if you scale up or down an equilateral triangle, its angles will remain the same and its sides will maintain the same ratios.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4) Yes, the two rhombus are similar because they have equal angles and their sides are proportional to each other. This means that if you scale up or down a rhombus, its angles will remain the same and its sides will maintain the same ratios.</p><p></p><p></p><p>5) No, the two isosceles trapezoids do not necessarily have to be similar. Similarity requires that all angles are congruent and all sides are proportional, not just one angle.</p><p></p><p></p><p>6) We cannot determine if the two rectangles are similar based solely on the given information. We would need to know if the ratios of corresponding sides are equal to determine similarity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>7) Yes, if two figures are congruent, then they are also similar. This is because congruent figures have the same shape and size, which means their corresponding angles and sides are equal.</p><p></p><p></p><p>8) Yes, if two figures are congruent, then they are also similar. This is because congruent figures have the same shape and size, which means their corresponding angles and sides are equal. Therefore, their ratios of corresponding sides will also be equal.</p><p></p><p></p><p>9) Yes, equiangular triangles are similar. This is because they have the same angles, which means their corresponding sides are proportional to each other.</p><p></p><p></p><p>10) No, the length and width of a similar rectangle would be 16 cm and 12 cm, respectively. This is because the ratio of corresponding sides is 4:3, so you can multiply the length and width of the original rectangle by 4/3 to get the dimensions of the similar rectangle.</p><br />

Write your answers on sheet of paper.Mrs. Reyes assigned the Grade 4 class in Math to find out howquadrilaterals are related to one another, so she grouped the classinto two. The first group was assigned to prepare cut-outs of different quadrilaterals like square, rhombus, parallelogram, rectangle and trapezoid. The other group was assigned to enumerate its similarities and differences by writing down the different properties of each quadrilateral. As the group finished working cooperatively and collaborately, they found all the characteristics of quadrilaterals and relate each figure to one another. They found out that both square and rhombus has 4 equal sides. But a square has 4 right angles while rhombus has no right angles.pasagot naman po ng tama ibrabrainlest ko po ang mag sasagot nyan asa pic po yung tanong​</h2><br />
