Those were barbarous days, and the custom of letting old people die was ot uncommon.5. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the cruel order filled his heart with sorrow. 6. On he went, climbing blindly upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama. 7. The son's surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. 8. With tearful eyes and an aching heart said farewell. The trembling mother's voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. "Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son." 9. Because he was able to accomplish the governor's order, that very hour the cruel law was abolished 10. The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised greatly, but he demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom.​</a>

This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon.1. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.2. The trembling mother's voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. The son's surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground.​</a>
