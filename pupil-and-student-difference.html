Excerpt 1 Recent research on learner-centered education and qualitative inquiry into student cognition have indicated the importance of student's processing of concepts to metaphor analysis can be attributed the growth of applied linguistic research happening today. The present investigation is anchored on metaphorical analysis espoused by Lakoff and Johnson (1980). Attempts to draw images associated with different mathematical operations of grade pupils in the Philippines. For systematic sampling, the data used in the analysis were drawn from the journal entries of 35 students written over three months. The investigation reveals the different metaphorical images associated with four mathematical operations. Moreover, strategies for independent learning and applied! linguistic methods to improve cognition are suggested. (Valdez &amp; Villorente-Saulo 2014, p. 138)​</a>

The only drinks they were permitted to offer were soya milk, calamansi juice and bottled water. The schools thought that students could perform better in class with these nutritious food instead of chips, street foods and soda. However, because of these limited options, some pupils started to bring their own tsitsirya, which they would usually buy from the store outside the school before the start of the class. According to them, these are way cheaper and more deicious. They are also easier to eat compared to hot dishes sold in the canteen. Because of this, some schools immediately organized meetings with the parents to discuss the matter and to look for better solutions to address the problem.

                                            Recent research on learner-centered education and qualitative inquiry into student cognition have indicated the importance of student's processing of concepts to metaphor analysis can be attributed the growth of applied linguistics research happening today. The present investigation is anchored on metaphorical analysis espoused by lakoff and johnson (1980). Attemps to draw images associated with different mathematical operations of grade pupils in the Philippines. For systematic sampling, tha data used in the analysis were drawn from the journal entries of 35 students written over three months. The investigation reveals the different metaphorical images associated with four mathematical operations. Suggesgs.

                                            Before the global pandemic, one of the issues that most schools had to deal with was the unhealthy eating habits of their students. Apart from imparting knowledge and skills, schools alsohad to look after the proper nutrition of their learners. This is whycanteens were only allowed to sell nutritious snacks such as arrozcaldo, champorado, breads and different kinds of kakanin likepulo, kutchinta, suman, and bibingka. The only drinks they werepermitted to offer were soya milk calamansi juice and bottledwoler. The schools thought that students could perform better inclass with these nutritious foods instead of chips, street foods andsoda However because of these limited options, some pupilsstarted to bring their own tsitsirya which they would usually buyfrom the store outside the school before the start of the class.According to them these are way cheaper and more deliciousThey are also easier to eat compared to hot dishes sold in thecanteen Because of this some schools immediately organizedmeetings with the parents to discuss the matter and to look forbetter solutions to address the problemSchools Viewpoints1.2.Student's Viewpoints1.2.Pls i need answers the due date is now!

Excerpt 1 Recent research on learner-centered education and qualitative inquiry into student cognition have indicated the importance of student's processing of concepts to metaphor analysis can be attributed the growth of applied linguistic research happening today. The present investigation is anchored on metaphorical analysis espoused by Lakoff and Johnson (1980). Attempts to draw images associated with different mathematical operations of grade pupils in the Philippines. For systematic sampling, the data used in the analysis were drawn from the journal entries of 35 students written over three months. The investigation reveals the different metaphorical images associated with four mathematical operations. Moreover, strategies for independent learning and applied! linguistic methods to improve cognition are suggested. (Valdez &amp; Villorente-Saulo 2014, p. 138)​</h2><br />

The focus on the effectiveness of communicative language teaching (CLT) on the speaking performance of Grade 10 pupils highlights the importance of using pedagogical approaches that prioritize communicative competence over rote memorization. The research design, a nonexperimental, non-equivalent method, provides a good foundation for evaluating the impact of CLT on the students' speaking skills.</p><p></p><p>The findings of the study, which show that there is a significant difference between the speaking skills of students taught with CLT and those taught with the traditional approach, demonstrate the importance of using communicative language teaching in the classroom. This highlights the need for language teachers to adopt teaching approaches that prioritize communicative competence over grammar and vocabulary acquisition.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the study by Luan Thi Hong Nguyen provides valuable insights into the impact of communicative language teaching on the speaking performance of students.

The only drinks they were permitted to offer were soya milk, calamansi juice and bottled water. The schools thought that students could perform better in class with these nutritious food instead of chips, street foods and soda. However, because of these limited options, some pupils started to bring their own tsitsirya, which they would usually buy from the store outside the school before the start of the class. According to them, these are way cheaper and more deicious. They are also easier to eat compared to hot dishes sold in the canteen. Because of this, some schools immediately organized meetings with the parents to discuss the matter and to look for better solutions to address the problem.

The present investigation is anchored on metaphorical analysis espoused by lakoff and johnson (1980). Attemps to draw images associated with different mathematical operations of grade pupils in the Philippines. For systematic sampling, tha data used in the analysis were drawn from the journal entries of 35 students written over three months. The investigation reveals the different metaphorical images associated with four mathematical operations. Suggesgs.

                            26. Before the global pandemic, one of the issues that most schools had to deal with was the unhealthy eating habits of their students. Apart from imparting knowledge and skills, schools alsohad to look after the proper nutrition of their learners. This is whycanteens were only allowed to sell nutritious snacks such as arrozcaldo, champorado, breads and different kinds of kakanin likepulo, kutchinta, suman, and bibingka. The only drinks they werepermitted to offer were soya milk calamansi juice and bottledwoler. The schools thought that students could perform better inclass with these nutritious foods instead of chips, street foods andsoda However because of these limited options, some pupilsstarted to bring their own tsitsirya which they would usually buyfrom the store outside the school before the start of the class.According to them these are way cheaper and more deliciousThey are also easier to eat compared to hot dishes sold in thecanteen Because of this some schools immediately organizedmeetings with the parents to discuss the matter and to look forbetter solutions to address the problemSchools Viewpoints1.2.Student's Viewpoints1.2.Pls i need answers the due date is now!
