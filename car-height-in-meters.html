Before beginning its initial descent, a roller coaster car is always pulled up the first hill to a high initial height. Work is done on the car (usually by a chain) to achieve this initial height. A coaster designer is considering three different incline angles at which to drag the 2000-kg car train to the top of the 60-meter high hill. In each case, the force applied to the car will be applied parallel to the hill. Her critical question is: which angle would require the most work?

From the top of a tower of height h meters the angle of depression of a red Car is
40⁰degree and the angle of depression of a blue Car which is on the opposite side of the tower is 55°degree. If the distance between the foot of the tower and the red car is 115 meters, then find the height of the tower and the distance between the two cars. 
Assume that the points of location of the two cars and the foot of the tower are
collinear (lies in the same line).</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To find the number of hours in d days, you would multiply the number of days by 24. Angel is 3 kgm lighter than Carlo, so her weight would be 3 kgm less than Carlo's. The height of the plant was d inches, so after a month of growth it would be 8 inches taller, making it d + 8 inches tall. Jefferson bought 60 meters of rope, and if he cuts it into r equal parts, each piece would be 60/r meters long. Peter sold 23 second hand cars last month, and this month he sold m more than that. Therefore, he sold a total of 23 + m second hand cars this month.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>SANA </strong><strong>MAKA </strong><strong>TULONG</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. We can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = 1/2mv^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the car, and v is the velocity of the car. Rearranging the equation, we get m = 2KE/v^2. Plugging in the values, we get m = 2(2000)/(28)^2 = 1.28 kg.</p><p></p><p>2. The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 1/2mv^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the golf ball, and v is the velocity of the golf ball. Plugging in the values, we get KE = 1/2(0.945)(241)^2 = 27,261 J.</p><p></p><p>3. The formula for potential energy is PE = mgh, where PE is the potential energy, m is the mass of the person, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height of the building. Rearranging the equation, we get m = PE/(gh). Plugging in the values, we get m = 700/(9.8)(74.8) = 0.96 kg.</p><p></p><p>4. It is not possible to calculate the height with only the mass and force given. We would need additional information such as the velocity or acceleration of the jet fighter, or the time it takes to reach a certain height, to calculate the height.</p><p></p><p>*Brainliest me</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>3. The initial PE of the ball is zero since it is at ground level.
